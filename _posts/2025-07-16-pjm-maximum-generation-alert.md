On July 16, 2025, PJM Interconnection, the largest U.S. power grid operator serving 65 million people across 13 states and Washington, D.C., issued a Maximum Generation Alert and Load Management Alert as temperatures soared across the eastern U.S. With a peak demand forecast of approximately 145,000 MW, PJM ordered all available generation resources to operate at full capacity to meet surging electricity needs driven by extreme heat. This alert, part of PJM’s procedural measures, signals tightening grid conditions and potential curtailments of power exports to neighboring regions, while advising transmission and generation owners to defer maintenance. The alert underscores broader challenges facing the U.S. power grid, including aging infrastructure, rising demand, and the complex transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.

## Why the Alert Was Issued

The Maximum Generation Alert, accompanied by a NERC EEA Level 1 designation, reflects PJM’s proactive response to a high load forecast of 145,063 MW at 4 p.m. on July 16, driven by temperatures exceeding 90°F across its footprint, as forecasted by the NOAA Climate Prediction Center. This alert ensures all resources are committed to meet electricity demand, firm transactions, and reserve requirements, with concerns about sustaining contingency reserves. The Load Management Alert signals potential activation of demand response programs, where contracted customers reduce usage to alleviate grid stress. These measures are critical as PJM’s grid faces unprecedented pressure from rising demand, particularly from air conditioning during heatwaves, and a growing mismatch between supply and demand due to retiring fossil fuel plants.

## The Strain on America’s Largest Grid

PJM’s service area, spanning Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, and D.C., is experiencing a demand surge exacerbated by electrification, data centers, and industrial growth. The grid operator reported a preliminary peak load of 143,947 MW on July 15, with expectations of continued high demand. PJM’s summer forecast predicted a peak of 154,000 MW, but extreme scenarios could push demand beyond the record 165,563 MW set in 2006. The grid’s 179,200 MW of generation capacity and 7,900 MW of demand response are being stretched thin, particularly as 104 GW of firm generation is slated for retirement by 2030, with only 22 GW of firm baseload replacements planned. This imbalance, coupled with delays in new generation, heightens blackout risks, potentially increasing outage hours 100-fold by 2030.

## Aging Infrastructure and Transformer Challenges

The U.S. electrical grid, much of it built in the 1960s and 1970s, is ill-equipped for modern demands. Over 55% of distribution transformers are over 33 years old, nearing their 40-year lifespan, and 70% of transmission lines are over 25 years old. This aging infrastructure struggles to accommodate the integration of distributed energy resources like solar and wind, which require advanced grid management. Compounding this, transformer demand is projected to rise by up to 260% by 2050 due to EVs, data centers, and renewables, yet domestic production lags, with only 18% of large power transformers manufactured in the U.S. in 2019. Supply chain disruptions and tariffs further exacerbate shortages, leading to long lead times and increased costs, which threaten project timelines and grid reliability.

## The Energy Transition Dilemma

The shift from fossil fuels to renewables, while critical for sustainability, has created a “severe mismatch” between baseload capacity and rising demand. The Department of Energy warns that continued retirements of coal and natural gas plants without adequate replacements could lead to significant outages, particularly during extreme weather when wind and solar generation may falter. PJM’s recent actions, including the Department of Energy’s emergency order to keep Pennsylvania’s Eddystone Generating Station operational past its May 2025 retirement, highlight efforts to maintain reliability. However, the slow pace of new renewable projects, hampered by interconnection delays and local opposition, underscores the need for faster grid modernization and investment in firm baseload capacity, such as natural gas or nuclear, to bridge the gap.

## Strategies to Mitigate Grid Stress

PJM is implementing several measures to address these challenges. The Reliability Resource Initiative, launched in May 2025, selected 51 projects to add 9,361 MW of capacity, including natural gas, nuclear, and battery storage, with most expected online by 2030. Reforms to the interconnection process, including automation and AI-enhanced tools with Google and Tapestry, have reduced the project backlog by 60%. Demand response programs, compensating customers for reducing usage during peak times, provide critical relief, as seen in PJM’s activation of these programs in June 2025. Additionally, exploring remanufactured transformers and smart grid technologies, such as advanced power flow controls and predictive analytics, can enhance resilience and efficiency, helping to balance supply and demand.

## Economic and Social Impacts

The grid’s strain has significant economic implications, with electricity prices surging over 20% in some PJM regions this summer due to tight supplies. For instance, next-day power prices at PJM’s West hub soared to $211 per MWh in June 2025, a 430% increase. Outages, if they occur, could cost millions per hour and disproportionately affect vulnerable communities, exacerbating inequities. However, investments in grid modernization and domestic transformer production, supported by initiatives like the proposed CIRCUIT Act, could create jobs and stimulate local economies, with data center construction alone contributing $243.5 million and 1,688 jobs per project. These efforts are vital for ensuring reliable power and supporting economic growth.

## Looking Ahead

PJM’s Maximum Generation Alert on July 16, 2025, highlights the urgent need for a resilient and modernized U.S. power grid. As temperatures soar and demand from AI-driven data centers, EVs, and electrification continues to climb, the grid faces unprecedented challenges. Aging infrastructure, transformer shortages, and the complex transition to renewables necessitate immediate action. By leveraging demand response, accelerating interconnection reforms, and investing in firm capacity and smart technologies, PJM and other grid operators can mitigate blackout risks and ensure reliability. The path forward requires collaboration between utilities, policymakers, and manufacturers to power America’s future sustainably and securely.
