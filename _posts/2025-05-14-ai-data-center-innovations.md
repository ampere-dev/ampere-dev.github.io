# AI Data Center Innovations: Stargate’s Scale and Immersion Cooling Breakthroughs

**May 14, 2025**

The AI revolution is driving transformative advancements in data center infrastructure, with projects like OpenAI’s Stargate and cutting-edge cooling solutions from Intel and Shell leading the charge. The Stargate project’s Phase 1 construction in Abilene, Texas, sets a new benchmark for hyperscale AI facilities, while Intel’s certification of Shell’s immersion cooling fluids marks an industry-first for energy-efficient data center operations. These developments address the escalating power and thermal demands of AI workloads, reshaping the future of computing. This article explores the Stargate project, Intel-Shell’s cooling innovation, and their broader implications for AI data centers.

## OpenAI’s Stargate Phase 1: A Hyperscale Milestone

The Stargate project, a $500 billion joint venture between OpenAI, Oracle, SoftBank, and MGX, is constructing its flagship data center in Abilene, Texas, with Phase 1 underway. This phase includes two buildings totaling 980,000 square feet and over 200 MW of power capacity, set to be energized in the first half of 2025. The facility will support GPU installations for OpenAI’s AI models, with plans to scale to 1 million GPUs by late 2025 or Q1 2026. A 360.5 MW natural gas plant and solar power with battery storage will ensure reliable energy, addressing grid constraints. Stargate’s expansion plans include additional U.S. sites and global locations, aiming to establish a network of sovereign AI infrastructure. Despite tariff-related delays slowing financing, the Abilene site’s progress signals robust momentum.

## Intel and Shell’s Immersion Cooling Breakthrough

Intel, in collaboration with Shell, has achieved an industry-first by certifying Shell’s lubricant-based immersion cooling fluids for Xeon-based data centers, as announced on May 13, 2025. After a two-year trial, Intel validated Shell’s single-phase immersion cooling technology, which submerges servers in non-conductive fluid to dissipate heat more efficiently than air cooling. This solution, optimized for Intel’s Xeon processors, reduces energy consumption by up to 30% and supports high-density AI workloads. The certification, backed by partners like Supermicro and Submer, sets a new standard for sustainable data center cooling, critical for facilities like Stargate handling megawatt-scale racks.

## Shell’s Cooling Fluids: A Global Standard

Shell’s immersion cooling fluids, certified by Intel, are now approved for global use in data centers, marking a significant milestone in thermal management. These fluids, developed through Shell’s lubricants division, offer superior heat transfer and energy efficiency, enabling denser server configurations without compromising performance. The technology is projected to help liquid cooling (including immersion) reach 36% of the data center cooling market by 2028. Shell’s solution aligns with the industry’s shift toward sustainability, reducing carbon footprints and operational costs for AI-driven facilities. This innovation is particularly relevant for hyperscale projects like Stargate, where cooling demands are escalating.

## Implications for AI Data Centers

The convergence of Stargate’s hyperscale ambitions and Intel-Shell’s cooling advancements addresses critical challenges in AI data centers: power and thermal management. AI workloads, with rack densities projected to reach 1–5 MW by 2030, demand robust infrastructure. Stargate’s 200 MW Phase 1 and planned 1.2 GW campus demonstrate the scale required, while immersion cooling enables denser, more efficient operations. These developments reduce reliance on strained grids, with Stargate’s natural gas and solar mix complementing Intel-Shell’s energy-saving cooling.

## Challenges and Opportunities

Despite their promise, these advancements face hurdles. Stargate’s financing is slowed by tariff uncertainties, potentially delaying global expansion. Immersion cooling, while efficient, requires significant upfront investment and retrofitting for existing data centers. Scalability and material costs for cooling fluids also pose challenges. However, opportunities abound: Stargate’s Abilene site could create thousands of jobs, boosting local economies, while Intel-Shell’s technology positions them as leaders in sustainable cooling. The U.S. Department of Energy’s push for AI data centers on federal land could further accelerate such projects.

## Looking Ahead

The Stargate project and Intel-Shell’s immersion cooling breakthrough signal a transformative era for AI data centers. By mid-2025, Stargate’s Phase 1 will power advanced AI models, while Shell’s certified fluids will enable global adoption of energy-efficient cooling. These innovations align with industry trends toward sustainability and hyperscale growth. As AI demand surges, overcoming tariff, scalability, and retrofitting challenges will be critical. The U.S. is poised to lead in AI infrastructure, with Stargate and immersion cooling paving the way for a resilient, sustainable future.
