I recently had a highly productive phone call with a sales representative from **Sunbelt Solomon**, a premier provider of new, remanufactured, and rental power transformers, substation-class equipment, switchgear, cables, and complete turnkey temporary power solutions. The conversation focused on exploring synergies between their extensive national inventory—spanning low- to high-voltage assets up to 230 kV and beyond—and our specialized expertise in **microgrid** design, integration, and operation. Our microgrids incorporate distributed energy resources (DERs) such as solar PV, battery energy storage systems (BESS), and diesel/natural gas generation, with seamless grid-parallel and islanded-mode functionality, IEEE 1547-compliant interconnection protection, automatic transfer schemes, and robust point-of-common-coupling (PCC) coordination.

The representative showed keen interest in our microgrid capabilities, particularly our track record with resilient, islandable systems and utility tie-in protections. They also inquired specifically about the composition, voltage classes, kVA/MVA ratings, and overall scale of our **transformer fleet**—our in-house inventory of oil-filled and dry-type distribution and substation units covering low-voltage (e.g., 480 V) through subtransmission levels (up to 69 kV and higher in select applications). I referenced my historical **CAPEX documentation** from previous utility-scale, industrial, and microgrid projects, which details transformer specifications including kVA ratings, BIL (Basic Impulse Level), percent impedance, winding configurations, cooling classes (e.g., ONAN/ONAF), and on-load tap changer (OLTC) or de-energized tap changer (DETC) setups. For current market benchmarking, I noted that I had recently obtained competitive pricing from **Maddox Industrial Transformer** on pad-mounted, substation-class, and specialty units, ensuring realistic cost projections for future procurements or rentals.

Looking forward to substation commissioning, upgrades, and microgrid tie-point validation, I expressed strong interest in sourcing or renting **medium- and high-voltage cabling** rated for **35 kV, 69 kV, and 115 kV** applications. These cables are critical for supporting field testing protocols such as high-potential (Hi-Pot) dielectric withstand testing, insulation resistance (IR) and polarization index (PI) measurements, partial-discharge (PD) analysis on bushings and terminations, and primary-side continuity checks on high-voltage apparatus prior to energization.

A key highlight of the discussion was our emphasis on **direct medium-voltage testing** capabilities—specifically **primary current injection testing** (also known as primary injection or through-fault simulation)—on medium-voltage switchgear, circuit breakers, current transformers (CTs), and protective relaying (typically 4.16 kV to 34.5 kV class, with extensions to higher voltages as needed). Unlike secondary injection, which applies low-level simulated currents only to relay inputs, primary injection delivers substantial test currents—often hundreds to several thousand amperes—directly into the **primary circuit** (e.g., through breaker bushings, transformer windings, or bus sections). This end-to-end verification confirms:

- Accurate **CT ratio**, polarity, burden performance, and saturation limits under realistic current levels.
- Correct phasing, wiring continuity, and secondary circuit integrity from CT secondaries through test switches, relay terminals, and trip circuits.
- Proper operation of multifunction numerical relays (e.g., SEL, GE, or Siemens models) for elements such as instantaneous/time-overcurrent (50/51), differential (87), directional (67), and distance (21), when subjected to primary-level fault currents.
- Functional integrity of trip coils, breaker operating mechanisms, auxiliary contacts, and interlocking schemes under actual current flow.

This testing is indispensable during initial substation energization, post-replacement commissioning, or microgrid PCC validation, as it reveals issues like polarity reversals, CT ratio errors, or relay misconfigurations that secondary testing might overlook—preventing costly false trips, failure-to-trip events, or protection miscoordination only discovered under live load.

To execute these tests effectively, we maintain interest in high-current primary injection test sets capable of sustained outputs up to several kA at low voltages (<10 V typical). When paired with Sunbelt Solomon's **portable rental substation** offerings—trailer-mounted, fully integrated mobile units that include step-up/step-down power transformers, medium-voltage metal-clad switchgear, vacuum circuit breakers, multifunction protective relaying, metering, SCADA interfaces, and auxiliary AC/DC systems—this setup enables a controlled, temporary interconnection to the local utility grid at the PCC. We can then perform live primary injection scenarios by routing current from the utility source through the mobile transformer's secondary, into our test sections or breakers, and back via shorting links or fault simulators—while capturing relay response, phasor-analyzed secondary currents (magnitude and angle), breaker timing, and scheme coordination. This approach aligns with IEEE C57.12 series standards, NETA Acceptance/Maintenance Testing Specifications (ATS/MTS), and utility interconnection requirements, significantly reducing commissioning risks, outage durations, and lead-time dependencies for future 35 kV, 69 kV, and 115 kV substation and microgrid projects.

The call underscored excellent alignment between our hands-on field-testing and microgrid expertise and Sunbelt Solomon's robust rental fleet, including customizable substation packages, high-voltage cables (up to 35 kV+), and turnkey temporary power solutions. I'm now compiling our detailed transformer fleet CAPEX records, proposed primary injection test protocols, and specific rental substation configuration needs for follow-up discussions. This partnership has strong potential to accelerate our upcoming high-voltage infrastructure and microgrid deployment initiatives.
