May 18, 2025

A May 18, 2025, article from Watts Up With That, citing a new International Energy Agency (IEA) report and the Iberian blackout, argues that the dream of a renewable energy transition is faltering under the weight of unreliable power and surging AI-driven demand. Solar and wind, while valuable, fail to deliver the baseload power needed for grid stability, as evidenced by Spain’s 2025 blackout and the North American Electric Reliability Corporation’s (NERC) warnings. The IEA’s “Energy and AI” report underscores AI’s escalating energy needs, while the U.S. faces a ~50 GW power shortfall. This article explores the limitations of renewables, the Iberian blackout, AI’s energy demands, and the urgent need for coal, LNG, and nuclear solutions. <a href="https://wattsupwiththat.com/2025/05/18/a-new-iea-report-and-the-iberian-blackout-end-dreams-of-an-energy-transition/" target="_blank">Read the Watts Up With That article</a>.

### Renewables’ Baseload Shortfall

Solar and wind power, despite their environmental appeal, cannot provide the consistent baseload power required for a stable grid. The NERC’s 2025 Summer Reliability Assessment warns of heightened blackout risks across North America due to insufficient dispatchable generation, with renewables’ intermittency exacerbating vulnerabilities. Posts on X echo this, noting that wind and solar output drops during peak demand, leaving grids reliant on fossil fuels or nuclear. The IEA report cited by Watts Up With That highlights that renewables’ variability strains grids as AI data centers demand constant power, underscoring the fallacy of expecting solar and wind to replace traditional sources long-term. <a href="https://www.nerc.com/pa/RAPA/ra/Reliability%20Assessments%20DL/NERC_SRA_2025.pdf" target="_blank">Read NERC’s 2025 Reliability Assessment</a>.

### The Iberian Blackout: A Cautionary Tale

Spain’s 2025 blackout, detailed in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece, exposed the fragility of renewable-heavy grids. On January 23, 2025, a sudden wind lull and cloud cover crippled Spain’s solar and wind output, causing widespread outages that left millions without power. Despite heavy investment in renewables, Spain’s grid lacked sufficient baseload capacity, relying on gas imports that couldn’t scale quickly enough. This incident, cited by Watts Up With That, shattered confidence in renewables’ reliability, with critics arguing that over-dependence on weather-driven sources risks economic and social disruption. The event mirrors U.S. grid concerns, where AI data centers amplify demand pressures. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/opinion/how-the-lights-went-out-in-spain-solar-power-electric-grid-0096bbc7?st=8yz1Tu" target="_blank">Read about Spain’s blackout</a>.

### AI’s Escalating Energy Demands

The IEA’s “Energy and AI” report projects that AI data centers could consume 4–6% of global electricity by 2030, driven by hyperscale projects like OpenAI’s 200 MW Stargate and Google’s 1 MW racks. In the U.S., data centers are forecast to use 9% of electricity by 2030, per McKinsey, with rack densities reaching 1–5 MW. These facilities require uninterrupted baseload power, which renewables struggle to provide. The IEA notes that AI’s energy intensity necessitates diverse sources, including nuclear and gas, to avoid grid failures. The Velvet-Wood mine’s fast-tracked uranium production aims to fuel nuclear reactors for AI, but renewables alone cannot meet this demand. <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/energy-and-ai" target="_blank">Read IEA’s Energy and AI report</a>.

### Coal, LNG, and Nuclear: Bridging the Gap

The U.S. faces a ~50 GW power deficit, as estimated by industry analysts, exacerbated by AI growth and renewable shortfalls. The Trump administration’s push to fast-track energy projects, exemplified by the Velvet-Wood mine’s 14-day permitting, signals a shift toward coal, LNG, and nuclear. A ZeroHedge report details plans to reopen shuttered coal plants and ease regulations, providing interim baseload power for AI data centers while nuclear capacity ramps up. LNG plants, like those planned for Stargate, offer flexibility, while nuclear projects, including Amazon’s SMR investments, promise long-term stability. These efforts draw inspiration from the NASA Apollo missions’ expedited management, prioritizing rapid deployment to meet urgent needs. <a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/energy/trump-set-sign-exec-order-boosting-domestic-coal-meet-ai-power-demands" target="_blank">Explore coal’s revival</a>.

### Challenges and Sustainability Concerns

Relying on coal and LNG raises environmental concerns, with the Sierra Club criticizing rushed permitting for risking air and water quality. The Iberian blackout highlights renewables’ unreliability, but scaling nuclear faces regulatory and cost hurdles, with thorium reactors still in early development. The NERC report warns that without new baseload capacity, blackouts could become frequent by 2035. Balancing sustainability with reliability requires innovation, such as Intel-Shell’s immersion cooling to reduce data center energy use, and 3D-printed transformers to enhance efficiency. Public skepticism, fueled by Spain’s outage, underscores the need for transparent energy planning. <a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/energy/nuclear-energy-world-awaits-trump" target="_blank">Explore thorium challenges</a>.

### Implications for the U.S. Energy Landscape

The U.S. energy crisis, driven by AI’s growth and renewable shortfalls, demands a diversified approach. The Velvet-Wood mine’s uranium will bolster nuclear capacity, critical for data centers like Microsoft’s Three Mile Island-powered facilities. Coal and LNG can provide immediate relief, but long-term reliance risks clashing with net-zero goals of tech giants like Google. The IEA and NERC emphasize that grid modernization and new power plants are non-negotiable to avoid Spain-like disruptions. Fast-tracking projects with Apollo-style urgency could add 50 GW by 2030, securing energy for AI, industry, and households while strengthening national security through domestic production. <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/09/20/three_mile_island_nuclear_plant_microsoft_ai/" target="_blank">Learn about Microsoft’s nuclear deal</a>.

### Looking Ahead

The U.S. is short by ~50 GW of needed power, a gap that renewables cannot bridge alone, as Spain’s blackout and the IEA’s findings demonstrate. The nation must fast-track multiple coal, LNG, and nuclear power plants with expedited management, emulating the NASA Apollo missions’ urgency in the 1960s. Projects like Velvet-Wood and Stargate highlight the stakes, powering AI’s future while addressing grid vulnerabilities. As projects like Google’s Arizona campus scale, the U.S. must balance speed, sustainability, and security to lead in AI and energy. The Velvet-Wood project sets a precedent for rapid, responsible energy development, shaping a resilient future. <a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/google-breaks-ground-on-first-arizona-data-center-in-mesa/" target="_blank">Discover Google’s Arizona project</a>.
