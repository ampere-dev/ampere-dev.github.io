The relentless rise of artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming industries, but it’s also driving an unprecedented surge in electricity demand across the United States. The nation’s largest power grid, PJM Interconnection, which serves 65 million people across 13 states and Washington, D.C., is struggling to keep up. As data centers powering AI applications multiply, electricity costs are soaring to record highs, and consumers are left footing the bill. Here’s a deep dive into why your utility bills are climbing and what it means for the future.

## A Perfect Storm: AI Data Centers and Strained Grids

PJM Interconnection, which spans from the Midwest to the mid-Atlantic, recently announced that businesses and households will pay a staggering $16.1 billion for electricity capacity in the year starting June 2026. This marks a significant jump from last year’s record of $14.7 billion, with the capacity price per megawatt-day hitting an all-time high of $329.17, up from $269.92. The reason? A massive buildout of power-hungry AI data centers, particularly in areas like Loudoun County, Virginia—known as “Data Center Alley,” the world’s largest hub for data centers.

These data centers, which support the computational demands of AI models, consume electricity at levels comparable to small cities. For context, a single large data center can use 100–300 megawatts of power, enough to supply tens of thousands of homes. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), global data center electricity consumption is projected to double between 2022 and 2026, reaching over 1,000 terawatt-hours—roughly equivalent to Japan’s annual electricity use.

Meanwhile, PJM has faced challenges this summer, issuing multiple “Maximum Generation” and “Load Management” alerts as heatwaves pushed air conditioning demand to the brink. Joe Bowring, president of Monitoring Analytics, PJM’s independent watchdog, told Bloomberg, “There is simply no new capacity to meet new loads.” This mismatch between supply and demand is exacerbating the crisis, as older power plants retire and investments in new generation and grid upgrades lag behind.

## Skyrocketing Costs and the Auction Controversy

PJM’s annual capacity auction, which determines how much power producers are paid to ensure reliable electricity supply, has become a lightning rod for controversy. This year’s auction, the first to include both a price floor ($177.24) and cap ($329.17), cleared at the maximum, raising questions about whether the process truly reflects market dynamics. Last year’s auction saw a 600% spike in capacity prices, sparking outrage and leading to a settlement with Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro to cap price increases for two years. Despite this, costs remain sky-high, with consumers in areas like Baltimore and Virginia facing rates as high as $466 and $444 per megawatt-day in previous auctions.

The financial impact is already hitting consumers. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) reports that average residential electricity prices have risen by 15% over the past five years, and with AI-driven demand accelerating, further increases are likely. For households, this could mean monthly utility bills climbing by 20–30% in the coming years, particularly in regions served by PJM.

## Winners and Losers in the AI Power Race

Independent power producers like Constellation Energy, Talen Energy, NRG, and Vistra are capitalizing on the demand surge, investing over $34 billion in 2025 to acquire natural gas plants. Natural gas, which accounts for about 40% of U.S. electricity generation, is increasingly seen as a critical bridge fuel to power data centers while renewable energy projects struggle to scale. However, consumers and small businesses are bearing the brunt of these costs. Jon Gordon, policy director at Advanced Energy United, noted that new data centers are coming online faster than the grid can adapt, exacerbating supply shortages. Meanwhile, investments in renewable energy and grid modernization are not keeping pace. The EIA estimates that only 15% of new electricity capacity added in 2024 came from renewables, with natural gas and coal plants filling the gap.

## The Bigger Picture: Can the Grid Keep Up?

The AI boom is just one part of a broader challenge facing the U.S. power grid. Aging infrastructure, retiring coal plants, and delays in renewable energy projects are creating a perfect storm. The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) has warned that parts of the U.S., including PJM’s region, face a high risk of power shortages by 2027 if demand continues to outstrip supply. Data centers are expected to account for 20% of U.S. electricity consumption by 2030, up from 4% today, according to McKinsey & Company.

Proposed solutions, like requiring data center operators to build their own power generation, are gaining traction. However, this could lead to a patchwork of private energy systems, potentially undermining grid reliability and increasing costs further. On the policy front, regulators are under pressure to balance consumer protections with the need to incentivize new power generation. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) is exploring reforms to capacity markets, but meaningful changes could take years.

## What Can Consumers Do?

For now, households and businesses face tough choices. Energy efficiency measures, such as upgrading to energy-efficient appliances or installing smart thermostats, can help offset rising costs. Some states offer demand response programs, where consumers are paid to reduce usage during peak periods. However, these are short-term fixes for a systemic issue that requires long-term investment in clean energy and grid infrastructure.

The AI revolution is reshaping the world, but it’s also exposing the fragility of our energy systems. As data centers continue to proliferate, the tension between technological progress and energy affordability will only intensify. Without bold action, consumers may find themselves paying a steep price for a future powered by AI.
