The North American data center market is experiencing a historic surge, fueled by the explosive growth of artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing. Hyperscalers—major cloud service providers like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft—are projected to command 60% of global data center capacity by 2030, according to recent industry analysis. This month, these industry giants, along with other key players, announced significant new projects across the United States, signaling a transformative era for digital infrastructure, economic growth, and energy demands.

## Major Investments Fueling AI and Cloud Growth

In Iowa, Google is investing $7 billion to bolster its cloud and AI infrastructure, including a new data center in Cedar Rapids and an expansion of its existing facility in Council Bluffs. This builds on Google’s long-standing commitment to the state, enhancing its capacity to support AI-driven workloads and fostering local workforce development programs.

In North Carolina, Amazon Web Services (AWS) announced a $10 billion expansion of its data center infrastructure in Richmond County. This investment is expected to create 500 high-skilled jobs and support community initiatives through education and training programs, reinforcing North Carolina’s position as a Southeast hub for AI and cloud innovation.

Pennsylvania is also a focal point for hyperscaler activity. Amazon is committing $20 billion—the largest capital expenditure in the state’s history—to develop AI innovation campuses in Salem and Falls Townships, with additional sites under consideration. Meanwhile, Constellation Energy is accelerating plans to restart the Unit 1 reactor at Three Mile Island, renamed the Crane Power Plant, to supply Microsoft with 835 MW of carbon-free power by 2027, a year ahead of schedule.

## Emerging Players and Innovative Designs

Northern Data Group, a German-based company, is entering the U.S. market with a 20 MW facility in Pittsburgh, designed for high-performance computing (HPC) and advanced AI model training. This project marks a strategic foothold for the company’s North American ambitions. In Virginia, EdgeCore Digital Infrastructure is planning a massive 3.9 million square foot campus in Louisa County, capable of supporting 1.1 GW of power, marking its third data center in the state. Additionally, Sabey Data Centers broke ground on the final phase of its Ashburn campus expansion in Loudoun County, Virginia, set to deliver 18 MW initially and an additional 36 MW in the future, with a ready-for-service date in 2026.

In an industry first, Cove Architecture in Colorado has completed the design of a 10,000 square foot data center using entirely AI-driven processes, a groundbreaking approach now navigating the permitting phase. This innovation highlights the growing integration of AI not only in data center operations but also in their design and development.

## Powering the Future: Energy Innovations and Challenges

The unprecedented demand for data center capacity is straining North America’s power infrastructure, prompting creative solutions. In Texas, MSB Global Services partnered with Sulphur Springs and Hopkins County for a groundbreaking 3 GW data center campus, showcasing the scale of hyperscaler ambitions. In Nevada, Crusoe and Redwood are collaborating on a 2,000-GPU data center powered by repurposed batteries, emphasizing sustainable energy solutions. Talen Energy also secured a power purchase agreement with Amazon to supply 1,920 MW of carbon-free electricity, underscoring the critical role of clean energy in meeting hyperscaler demands.

However, power constraints remain a significant hurdle. The International Energy Agency predicts that global electricity demand from AI-driven data centers could double by 2026, outpacing current grid capacities. In response, hyperscalers are exploring alternatives like small modular reactors (SMRs) and natural gas-powered facilities. For instance, Homer City Redevelopment and Kiewit Power Constructors are transforming Pennsylvania’s former Homer City Generating Station into a 4.5 GW natural gas-powered data center campus, a $10 billion project tailored for AI and HPC workloads.

## Economic and Community Impacts

These data center projects are driving significant economic benefits. Amazon’s investments in North Carolina and Pennsylvania include community funds to support education, sustainability, and digital inclusion, with $400,000 in combined grants allocated for local projects. Google’s Iowa expansion will also bring workforce development programs, enhancing local economies. The Data Center Coalition reports that the industry contributed $2.1 trillion to U.S. GDP between 2017 and 2021, and projects like these are expected to create thousands of jobs, from construction to high-tech roles.

However, the rapid expansion raises concerns about grid reliability and resource allocation. The closure of reliable baseload power sources, such as coal and nuclear plants, combined with slower-than-needed renewable energy development, has created a supply-demand mismatch. For example, PJM Interconnection, serving 67 million customers across 13 states, reported an 800% spike in power plant capacity costs in its 2024 auction, driven by data center demand. This has led to projected electricity bill increases of over 20% in some regions, with Pennsylvania businesses facing up to 29% hikes.

## China’s Contrast: A Lesson in Speed

While the U.S. navigates regulatory and infrastructural challenges, China offers a contrasting model of rapid power plant construction. In 2024, China initiated 94.5 GW of new coal-fired power plants and resumed 3.3 GW of previously suspended projects, permitting an average of two large plants per week since 2022. Its nuclear sector is also booming, with 58 operational plants (60.88 GW) and 27 under construction (32.31 GW), achieving build times of five to seven years. China’s streamlined supply chains and focus on energy security enable this pace, a stark contrast to the U.S., where permitting delays and policy fragmentation slow progress. While China’s coal reliance raises environmental concerns, its ability to meet energy demand offers insights for U.S. policymakers aiming to balance reliability and sustainability.

## Looking Ahead

The North American data center boom, driven by hyperscalers and AI demand, is reshaping the region’s digital and energy landscapes. With investments exceeding $31.5 billion in U.S. data center construction in 2024 alone, the industry shows no signs of slowing. However, addressing power constraints, modernizing aging grid infrastructure, and balancing sustainability with reliability will be critical to sustaining this growth. By investing in clean energy, streamlining regulations, and fostering community partnerships, the U.S. can meet the demands of the AI era while driving economic prosperity.
