May 18, 2025

The United States is witnessing an unprecedented surge in data center construction, fueled by the escalating demand for artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing infrastructure. While DataCenterKnowledge’s May 2025 roundup highlighted significant projects like Meta’s $1 billion Wisconsin investment and NTT’s Arizona expansion, numerous other developments across the country are shaping the industry’s future. This article explores new U.S. data center projects not covered in the aforementioned report, emphasizing their scale, innovation, and impact on the AI-driven digital economy. <a href="https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/data-center-construction/new-data-center-developments-may-2025" target="_blank">Read the DataCenterKnowledge May 2025 roundup</a>.

### Homer City’s Massive 4.5 GW Campus

In Pennsylvania, the Homer City Generating Station, once the state’s largest coal-burning power plant, is being transformed into a 4.5-gigawatt data center campus tailored for AI and high-performance computing. Homer City Redevelopment and Kiewit Power Constructors signed a $10 billion deal to develop this 3,200-acre facility, which will leverage natural gas to ensure reliable power. The project, expected to break ground in 2025, aims to capitalize on the site’s existing infrastructure to meet the energy demands of hyperscale AI workloads. <a href="https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/data-center-construction/new-data-center-developments-april-2025" target="_blank">Learn about the Homer City project</a>.

### Amazon’s $2 Billion Ohio Expansion

Amazon is advancing its cloud computing footprint with a $2 billion data center campus in Sunbury, Ohio, part of a broader $10 billion investment in the state. The 450,000-square-foot facility, set to occupy 200 acres in an industrial park, is scheduled to begin construction in January 2028, with completion targeted for December 2034. This project complements Amazon’s earlier $7.8 billion Ohio investments, reinforcing central Ohio’s status as a data center hub. <a href="https://www.constructiondive.com/news/multibillion-dollar-data-center-projects-to-watch/705011/" target="_blank">Explore Amazon’s Ohio plans</a>.

### Google’s $600 Million Arizona Data Center

Google broke ground in July 2023 on a 750,000-square-foot data center in Mesa, Arizona, with the first phase expected to be operational by July 2025. This $600 million facility will support Google’s core services, including Gmail and Google Cloud, and ties into the establishment of a new Phoenix cloud region. The project underscores Google’s aggressive expansion to meet AI and cloud infrastructure demands, leveraging Arizona’s growing status as a data center hotspot. <a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/google-breaks-ground-on-first-arizona-data-center-in-mesa/" target="_blank">Read about Google’s Mesa project</a>.

### Aligned Data Centers’ Texas Campus

Aligned Data Centers is expanding in the Dallas-Fort Worth area with a new 27-acre campus in Mansfield, Texas, named DFW-03. Set to go live in Q4 2025, this facility will support AI, cloud, and enterprise workloads with an on-site substation to ensure power reliability. The project responds to the region’s booming demand for data center capacity, driven by Texas’ business-friendly environment and robust energy infrastructure. <a href="https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/data-center-construction/new-data-center-developments-march-2025" target="_blank">Discover Aligned’s Texas expansion</a>.

### Northern Data’s 120 MW Georgia Project

Northern Data Group is developing a 120-megawatt high-performance computing data center in Maysville, Georgia, approximately 70 miles northeast of Atlanta. The 63-acre campus, expected to be fully operational by Q1 2027, will cater to AI-driven workloads. This project highlights Georgia’s emergence as a key data center market, bolstered by its access to power and proximity to Atlanta’s tech ecosystem. <a href="https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/data-center-construction/new-data-center-developments-january-2025" target="_blank">Learn about Northern Data’s Georgia campus</a>.

### Teton Digital’s 100 MW North Dakota Development

Teton Digital has received approval for a 100-megawatt data center in North Dakota, a state increasingly attractive for its abundant energy resources and cold climate, ideal for cooling efficiency. The project, greenlit in early 2025, aims to support AI and high-performance computing with a focus on sustainable energy integration. This development positions North Dakota as an emerging player in the U.S. data center landscape. <a href="https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/data-center-construction/new-data-center-developments-april-2025" target="_blank">Read about Teton Digital’s North Dakota project</a>.

### Challenges and Opportunities

These projects face challenges such as power infrastructure bottlenecks, regulatory hurdles, and land scarcity in traditional data center hubs like Northern Virginia. However, innovations like nuclear power integration—seen in Amazon’s and Microsoft’s nuclear deals—and sustainable cooling solutions are creating opportunities. The U.S. Department of Energy’s plan to fast-track data center development on federal land, leveraging nuclear reactors, could further accelerate growth. <a href="https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/energy-power-supply/data-centers-bypassing-the-grid-to-obtain-the-power-they-need" target="_blank">Explore grid bypass and nuclear trends</a>.

The economic impact is significant, with projects generating thousands of jobs and billions in local investment. For instance, Google’s Indiana project is expected to bolster Fort Wayne’s economy, while Amazon’s Ohio campus will create long-term employment opportunities. Strategic site selection and partnerships with utilities are critical to overcoming power constraints. <a href="https://www.jll.com/en-us/insights/data-center-outlook" target="_blank">See JLL’s 2025 Data Center Outlook</a>.

### Looking Ahead

The U.S. data center market is on track to add 10 gigawatts of new capacity in 2025, driven by AI and cloud demand. Projects like Homer City’s 4.5 GW campus and Google’s Arizona facility highlight the scale of investment, while emerging markets like North Dakota and Georgia offer new growth opportunities. As tech giants and developers navigate power and regulatory challenges, nuclear energy and federal land initiatives could redefine the industry’s trajectory. <a href="https://www.constructiondive.com/news/multibillion-dollar-data-center-projects-to-watch/705011/" target="_blank">Discover major 2025 data center projects</a>.
