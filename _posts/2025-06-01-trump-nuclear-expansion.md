President Donald J. Trump’s ambitious plan to quadruple U.S. nuclear capacity to 400 GW by 2050, outlined in a May 28, 2025, Utility Dive article, aims to meet surging AI data center demand and bolster energy security. Coupled with a Deloitte report from April 15, 2025, highlighting small modular reactors (SMRs) as a key solution for powering data centers, these developments signal a nuclear renaissance. With 10 large reactors targeted for construction by 2030 and SMRs poised to deliver 10% of data center power needs by 2035, the U.S. is reshaping its grid. This article explores Trump’s nuclear strategy, SMRs’ role in AI infrastructure, and implications for grid resilience, drawing on industry insights.

## Trump’s Nuclear Vision: 400 GW by 2050

Trump’s executive orders, signed on May 23, 2025, target a fourfold increase in nuclear capacity from 100 GW to 400 GW by 2050, with 10 large reactors under construction by 2030 and 5 GW of power uprates at existing plants. The orders streamline Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) approvals, setting 18-month deadlines for new reactors and 12 months for existing ones, while invoking the Defense Production Act to boost domestic uranium production. The DOE is tasked with completing unfinished reactors, like the AP1000 units at Santee Cooper’s VC Summer site, and deploying SMRs on federal lands. This aligns with a 25% electricity demand surge by 2030, driven by AI, per ICF projections.

## SMRs: Powering AI Data Centers

The Deloitte report emphasizes SMRs’ potential to meet 10% of the 35% data center demand increase by 2035, offering compact, scalable power for AI facilities. SMRs, like GE Vernova’s BWRX-300, approved for Ontario in 2025, are factory-built, reducing construction time by 30% compared to traditional reactors. Their 50–300 MW capacity suits data centers like Oracle’s planned SMR-powered facility, requiring 1–5 MW per rack. SMRs provide carbon-free, 24/7 power, addressing AI’s 9% U.S. electricity share by 2030, per McKinsey. Load bank testing ensures SMR integration, validating UPS and generators for hyperscale needs, per NFPA 110.

## Grid Resilience and AI Infrastructure

AI data centers amplify grid strain, with NERC’s 2025 assessment warning of blackout risks by 2035 due to a ~50 GW deficit. Nuclear’s baseload reliability, unlike renewables, mitigates risks seen in Spain’s 2025 blackout. Trump’s orders support projects like Microsoft’s 837 MW Three Mile Island restart, powering AI workloads by 2028. SMRs enhance resilience, with modular designs enabling rapid deployment, per Oklo’s 2028 target. Domestic transformer shortages, with 120-week lead times, necessitate suppliers like MGM/VanTran, backed by DOE’s FITT program, to ensure stable power delivery.

## Advancements in Nuclear Technology

Trump’s orders prioritize advanced reactors, including SMRs and Generation IV designs, using innovative cooling like liquid sodium or molten salt. NuScale’s 460 MW US460 SMR, approved in 2025, and GE Vernova’s BWRX-300 showcase progress. These reactors promise safer, cheaper power, with SMRs reducing costs by 20% through prefabrication. The DOE’s pilot for three experimental reactors by July 2026 and Army deployment of an SMR by 2028 accelerate innovation, supporting AI and defense needs.

## National Security and Economic Impact

Foreign reliance on uranium, with 99% imported, poses security risks. Trump’s orders designate the nuclear fuel cycle as critical, expanding domestic capacity, as seen in Velvet-Wood’s uranium production. Nuclear stocks like Oklo (+145% YTD) and Centrus soared, reflecting market optimism. Economically, projects create thousands of jobs, with Holtec’s Palisades restart adding $363 million to Michigan’s GDP. SMRs for data centers and military bases enhance defense resilience, powering cyberwarfare and AI infrastructure.

## Challenges and Criticisms

Scaling nuclear capacity faces hurdles, with Vogtle’s $16 billion overrun highlighting costs. Critics warn that NRC staff cuts and 18-month deadlines risk safety, while waste storage remains unresolved. Transformer shortages and workforce needs—tripling the 15,000-strong industry—delay progress. Environmental exemptions under NEPA for federal projects raise concerns. Load bank testing and AI-driven monitoring are essential to mitigate risks, ensuring reliability.

## Future Outlook

Trump’s nuclear push, targeting 400 GW by 2050, positions the U.S. as an AI and energy leader. SMRs, delivering 10% of data center power by 2035, will drive growth, with Oklo and NuScale leading. Innovations like smart transformers and liquid cooling will support AI infrastructure. By 2030, 10 new reactors and 5 GW uprates could add 15% to nuclear capacity. With public-private partnerships and Apollo-era urgency, the U.S. can overcome challenges, securing a resilient grid for AI and beyond.
