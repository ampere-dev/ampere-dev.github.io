Microsoft’s $1.6 billion agreement with Constellation Energy to restart Three Mile Island Unit 1—the dormant reactor at the Pennsylvania site infamous for the 1979 partial meltdown—marks a major step in deploying reliable, carbon-free baseload power for AI infrastructure. Renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center, the project targets 837 MW of output by 2028, directly supporting Microsoft’s data centers and broader net-zero ambitions. This revival addresses surging AI electricity demand and the U.S.’s projected ~50 GW power shortfall. Drawing from the January 2025 Wall Street Journal video and industry reporting, this article covers the project’s scope, its critical role in AI power supply, grid reliability benefits, challenges, economic/environmental impacts, and implications for the future energy mix.

## Overview of the Three Mile Island Restart

Unit 1, which operated safely from 1978 until its 2019 economic shutdown, will undergo extensive upgrades including new turbines, generators, control systems, and cooling enhancements. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) must approve the restart, with key milestones expected by 2027 and commercial operation targeted for 2028. Under a 20-year power purchase agreement, all 837 MW will flow to Microsoft’s AI data centers in Pennsylvania and other states (Chicago, Virginia, Ohio). The $1.6 billion investment is projected to create 3,400 construction and operational jobs while contributing approximately $16 billion to Pennsylvania’s economy over the project lifetime, demonstrating nuclear’s potential for regional revitalization.

## Powering AI Data Centers

AI facilities require constant, high-quality baseload power to sustain GPU-intensive workloads without interruption—projected to drive up to 9% of U.S. electricity consumption by 2030. Three Mile Island’s restart provides dedicated, carbon-free capacity that bypasses grid congestion and intermittency issues plaguing renewable-heavy systems (as seen in the 2025 Iberian blackout). This aligns with parallel industry moves: Amazon’s nuclear-powered data center investments and Google’s small modular reactor (SMR) pursuits. For hyperscale projects like OpenAI’s Stargate, stable nuclear output ensures 1–5 MW rack densities operate reliably, reducing dependence on variable renewables or strained transmission lines.

## Enhancing Grid Reliability

NERC’s 2025 reliability assessments warn of increasing blackout risks through 2035 due to retirements, electrification, and AI-driven load growth. Three Mile Island Unit 1 delivers firm, 24/7 baseload that counters renewable variability and adds critical inertia to the grid. Load bank testing during recommissioning will validate generator performance, voltage regulation, and transient response before grid integration. The project complements domestic uranium supply efforts (e.g., fast-tracked Velvet-Wood mine) and pairs well with storage (Tesla Megapacks) and advanced monitoring to create a more resilient system capable of supporting both AI expansion and broader electrification.

## Challenges and Criticisms

The restart faces significant technical, regulatory, and perceptual obstacles. Upgrading 50-year-old infrastructure to current safety and efficiency standards is costly and time-intensive, with potential for delays in NRC licensing or supply chains. Nuclear critics point to high capital costs, long construction timelines, and unresolved spent fuel storage. Public apprehension lingers from the 1979 TMI-2 accident, despite Unit 1’s unblemished operational history. Environmental groups raise concerns about thermal discharge and waste, though proponents emphasize nuclear’s low lifecycle emissions. Modern mitigations—AI-driven power quality monitoring, modular substations, and rigorous testing—help address reliability and safety risks.

## Economic and Environmental Impact

Economically, the project delivers substantial benefits: billions in taxes, thousands of high-quality jobs, and local supply-chain stimulus in Pennsylvania. Environmentally, it advances Microsoft’s carbon-negative target by 2030, displacing fossil generation and supporting AI growth without proportional emissions increases. However, nuclear alone cannot close the full 50 GW U.S. gap; coal, natural gas (LNG), renewables, and storage must all scale in parallel. Complementary technologies like immersion cooling (Intel-Shell) and grid-edge intelligence further improve overall efficiency and reduce environmental footprint.

## Looking Ahead

The Three Mile Island restart is a bellwether for nuclear’s renaissance, driven squarely by the insatiable power needs of AI data centers. By 2028, its 837 MW of clean, reliable output will directly fuel Microsoft’s AI operations and set a template for reactivating other shuttered reactors or deploying new SMRs (as pursued by Amazon and Google). While cost overruns, regulatory delays, and public perception remain hurdles, advances in monitoring, testing, and modular infrastructure promise smoother execution. Amid a national power deficit requiring urgent action, the U.S. must accelerate nuclear, coal, LNG, and renewable capacity additions with historic determination. Three Mile Island’s revival underscores that balanced, baseload-heavy energy strategies are essential to power the AI era securely and sustainably.
