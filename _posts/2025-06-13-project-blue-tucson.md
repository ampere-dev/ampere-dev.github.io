A June 9, 2025, Arizona Daily Star article reports that Pima County’s Board of Supervisors is set to vote on June 17, 2025, on a proposed multi-billion-dollar data center complex, codenamed Project Blue, planned for a 290-acre county-owned site near the Pima County Fairgrounds in southeast Tucson. The project, shrouded in secrecy due to a nondisclosure agreement (NDA), could include 8 to 10 data centers, raising concerns about water and electricity use. Supervisors demand transparency before approving the $20.8 million land sale and zoning changes. This article explores Project Blue’s scope, resource concerns, economic promises, and the transparency debate surrounding its development.

## Scope of Project Blue

Project Blue, proposed for a 290-acre site north of Brekke Road, bounded by Harrison and Houghton Roads, envisions a massive complex of 8 to 10 data centers, potentially spanning 2.5 million square feet across three construction phases. The site, currently owned by Pima County, is slated for sale to Humphrey’s Peak Properties, LLC, of San Francisco, with Beale Infrastructure as the developer, per a June 11, 2025, memo from County Administrator Jan Lesher. Construction could begin in 2026, with the first buildings operational by 2027, and the project is expected to invest $1.2 billion in construction and $2.4 billion in equipment over three years.

## Water Usage Concerns

Data centers are notorious for high water consumption, with mid-sized facilities using as much as 1,000 households daily, equivalent to about 146,000 gallons. Project Blue plans to phase in reclaimed water via an 18-mile pipeline, funded by the developer, to avoid impacting Tucson’s potable water supply. The project commits to being “water positive,” replenishing more water than it consumes through a 30-acre aquifer recharge project, per Lesher’s memo. However, specifics on water volume, pipeline capacity, and timelines remain undisclosed due to the NDA, raising concerns among supervisors like Steve Christy and Matt Heinz, who fear initial reliance on drinking water.

## Electricity Demand and Grid Impact

Project Blue is poised to become one of Tucson Electric Power’s (TEP) largest electricity users, exacerbating regional grid strain. TEP’s 2024 forecast predicts a 5% annual demand increase over the next decade, driven by data centers and AI workloads, up from 2.7% since 2019. The project’s long-term power agreement with TEP aims to protect ratepayers and enhance reliability, but specifics are undisclosed. Medium voltage load banks, using three cables, test substation settings, ensuring stable power delivery and reducing outage risks by 15%. Supervisors worry about undisclosed energy use, given national estimates that data centers could consume 8% of U.S. power by 2030.

## Economic Promises and Job Creation

Lesher’s memo touts Project Blue’s economic benefits, projecting 180 long-term jobs by 2029 with an average salary of $64,000, higher than Tucson’s 2024 median wage of $46,450. Construction will generate 1,024 direct and 2,049 indirect jobs, with $1.2 billion in capital investment and $250 million in tax revenues for Tucson and Pima County over 10 years, starting in 2026. The Chamber of Southern Arizona’s economic impact analysis supports these claims, but supervisors like Jennifer Allen question whether the benefits justify the secrecy, given the project’s resource demands.

## Transparency and Nondisclosure Agreement Debate

The NDA between Pima County, Tucson, and the developer has sparked controversy, shielding details about Project Blue’s water and energy use, developer identity, and technology. Supervisors Christy, Heinz, and Allen refuse to vote without full disclosure, arguing the public deserves transparency. Deputy County Administrator Carmine DeBonis defends the NDA, noting its 18-month term, signed June 18, 2024, is standard in competitive economic development. Critics, including environmentalist Christina McVie and water expert David Wegner, argue NDAs undermine public trust, especially given Arizona’s water scarcity and grid challenges.

## Community and Environmental Concerns

Project Blue’s resource demands raise environmental concerns in a region facing a megadrought. Tucson’s groundwater and Colorado River supplies are strained, and data centers’ water use, though less than agriculture’s, pressures local utilities. The proposed reclaimed pipeline could benefit residents, but lack of specifics fuels skepticism. Posts on X reflect public unease, with users citing Tucson’s limited water. Supervisors worry about unequal regulatory treatment, as data centers face fewer water restrictions than housing developments.

## Proposed Actions and Next Steps

The Board of Supervisors will vote on June 17 or July 1, 2025, on a $20.8 million land sale, a comprehensive plan amendment, and a specific plan allowing light industrial uses, including data centers. Lesher’s team plans to release a sales contract, economic impact analysis, and FAQ responses, but general water and energy details may lack specifics due to the NDA. The City of Tucson intends to annex the land post-sale, integrating it into city limits. Supervisors demand clarity to ensure Project Blue aligns with Tucson’s sustainability goals.

## Looking Ahead

Project Blue’s proposed 8 to 10 data centers near Tucson’s Pima County Fairgrounds promise economic growth but ignite debate over water, electricity, and transparency. With 180 jobs, $250 million in taxes, and a water-positive commitment, the project could transform southeast Tucson, but undisclosed resource demands worry supervisors and residents. Medium voltage load bank testing will ensure grid reliability, while reclaimed water pipelines aim to mitigate scarcity. As Pima County votes on June 17, 2025, transparency will determine whether Project Blue balances AI-driven growth with Tucson’s desert constraints, shaping a sustainable future.
