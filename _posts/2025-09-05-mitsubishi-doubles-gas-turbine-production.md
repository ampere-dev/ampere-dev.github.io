September 05, 2025

Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) is set to double its gas turbine production capacity over the next two years, responding to a surge in global demand driven by the rapid expansion of artificial intelligence (AI) and data centers. CEO Eisaku Ito announced the ambitious plan on August 29, 2025, emphasizing that initial targets to boost production by 30% fall short of meeting current orders. This move comes as gas turbine manufacturers worldwide report record orders, with data centers emerging as a key driver for reliable, scalable power solutions. Amid a U.S. energy deficit of 45 GW, hyperscalers are increasingly turning to localized peak shavers or fully off-grid operations, while exploring small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs) for long-term energy independence. This article examines MHI's expansion, the underlying market dynamics, and the broader implications for energy infrastructure. <a href="https://www.powermag.com/mitsubishi-will-double-gas-turbine-production-as-demand-grows/">[POWER Magazine: Mitsubishi Gas Turbine Production]</a>

### Surging Demand: The AI and Data Center Boom Fuels Gas Turbine Orders

The global gas turbine market is experiencing a renaissance, with demand outpacing supply as utilities and industries replace aging infrastructure and build new natural gas-fired power plants. MHI's decision to double production reflects this trend, as CEO Ito noted, "We were working towards boosting production capacity by 30%, but that’s not enough to meet growing demand." The company's focus on efficient supply chains and manufacturing protocols aims to address rising costs for raw materials, components, and labor, ensuring competitiveness in a cyclical industry.

Competitors like GE Vernova and Siemens Energy are seeing similar growth. China Merchant Securities reported that GE Vernova's new turbine orders nearly tripled year-over-year, reaching 55 GW with projections of 60 GW by year-end. Siemens Energy's orders rose 17%, with a third attributed to data centers. Both companies reported revenue for their gas turbine businesses at least three times higher than the previous year. GE Vernova's Scott Strazik highlighted a backlog growth of over $5 billion, including deals like 29 LM2500XPRESS aeroderivative units for Crusoe AI data centers.

Data centers, particularly those supporting AI workloads, are the primary catalyst. A single hyperscale facility can consume 100–300 MW, equivalent to a small city's power needs. The International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasts global data center electricity consumption will double to over 1,000 TWh by 2026, rivaling Japan's annual use. In the U.S., data centers could account for 20% of electricity by 2030, up from 4% today, according to McKinsey & Company. This demand is straining grids like PJM Interconnection, prompting manufacturers to ramp up production. <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/data-centres-and-data-transmission-networks">[IEA Data Centers Report]</a> <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-cost-of-compute-a-7-trillion-race-to-scale-data-centers">[McKinsey AI Data Centers]</a>

### The U.S. Energy Deficit: A 45 GW Gap Drives Innovation in Power Solutions

The U.S. faces a 45 GW energy deficit, exacerbated by retiring coal and nuclear plants (104 GW by 2030) and lagging new additions (only 22 GW firm baseload planned). The DOE's July 2025 Grid Reliability Evaluation warns of a 100-fold blackout risk increase by 2030 without action. PJM's peak load could rise 70 GW by 2040, largely from data centers, while MISO and other operators grapple with similar shortfalls.

In this context, data centers and hyperscalers are planning localized peak shavers—on-site gas turbines or batteries—to manage demand spikes, reducing reliance on strained grids. For instance, during high-load periods, peak shavers can provide 10–50 MW bursts, shaving costs by 20–30% through demand response programs. Some are exploring 100% off-grid operations, using combined cycle gas turbines (CCGTs) with efficiencies up to 64% for baseload power. Amazon's $20 billion nuclear-backed data center in Pennsylvania and Microsoft's reactivation of Three Mile Island exemplify this shift, blending gas with other sources for resilience.

Gas turbines offer quick deployment (6–12 months vs. 5–10 years for nuclear) and lower upfront costs ($800–$1,200/kW installed), making them ideal for bridging the deficit. However, with electricity prices up 15% since 2020 and projections of 20–30% increases in PJM regions, off-grid strategies could save hyperscalers millions annually while enhancing reliability. <a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/department-energy-releases-report-evaluating-us-grid-reliability-and-security">[DOE Grid Reliability Report]</a> <a href="https://www.pjm.com/-/media/planning/res-adeq/2025-long-term-load-forecast-report.ashx">[PJM Load Forecast]</a>

### SMRs: A Nuclear Renaissance for Localized Data Center Power

As gas turbines fill immediate needs, small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs) are gaining traction for long-term, carbon-neutral power. At least eight SMR manufacturers are being considered for data center applications: NuScale Power (VOYGR, 77 MW/module), GE Hitachi (BWRX-300, 300 MW), Holtec International (SMR-160, 160 MW), TerraPower (Natrium, 345 MW), X-energy (Xe-100, 80 MW), Kairos Power (Hermes, 140 MW), Oklo (Aurora, 15 MW), and Ultra Safe Nuclear (Micro Modular Reactor, 15 MW). These designs offer scalability, with deployment times of 3–5 years and costs of $3,000–$6,000/kW.

SMRs provide baseload power with 95%+ capacity factors, ideal for AI's constant demand. Projects like Virginia Green Energy Partners' plan for 20–30 data centers powered by four to six SMRs highlight their potential. However, regulatory hurdles (e.g., NRC approvals) and fuel supply chains remain challenges. With the U.S. needing a 100-fold capacity increase for resiliency, SMRs could complement gas turbines, creating hybrid systems for off-grid data centers. <a href="https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/energy-power-supply/us-energy-experts-highlight-potential-nuclear-powered-data-centers">[Data Center Knowledge: Nuclear-Powered Data Centers]</a> <a href="https://www.nuscalepower.com/en/products/voygr-smr-plants">[NuScale VOYGR]</a>

### Economic and Policy Considerations: Navigating Cyclical Demand

The turbine market's cyclical nature poses risks, as Ito noted, with uncertainty beyond the next decade. MHI aims for lean operations to mitigate this, but rising costs (20–30% for materials and labor) could pressure margins. Globally, orders exceed 100 GW annually, with data centers accounting for 30–40%. In the U.S., PJM's $16.1 billion capacity auction (up 9% YoY) reflects this, with prices at $329.17/MW-day.

Policy supports growth: Trump's EO 14262 prioritizes reliability, while FERC Order 1920 mandates regional transmission planning. However, environmental pushback—e.g., Michigan's suit against DOE orders—highlights tensions. Gas turbines, with lower emissions than coal (50% less CO₂), serve as a bridge to renewables and SMRs, aligning with net-zero goals. <a href="https://www.ferc.gov/news-events/news/ferc-approves-transformative-transmission-planning-rule">[FERC Order 1920]</a> <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2025/04/08/executive-order-strengthening-the-reliability-and-security-of-the-united-states-electric-grid">[EO 14262]</a>

### The Road Ahead: Balancing Growth and Sustainability

MHI's expansion positions it to capture a growing market, but the U.S. energy deficit demands innovative solutions. Localized peak shavers and off-grid strategies offer short-term relief, while SMRs promise a nuclear-powered future. As data centers proliferate, hybrid approaches—gas for flexibility, nuclear for baseload—will be key to resiliency. Without action, blackouts could rise 100-fold by 2030, underscoring the urgency of these developments.
