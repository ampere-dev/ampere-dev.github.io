As global electricity demand is projected to double over the next two decades, the United States faces an unprecedented challenge to its energy infrastructure. This growth, unseen since the post-World War II era, is driven by the rise of AI-driven data centers, advanced manufacturing, and the push for electric vehicles. However, the nation’s aging electrical grid and shifting energy policies are struggling to keep pace, raising concerns about potential electricity rationing in the future.

## The Growing Demand and a Strained Grid

The U.S. Energy Department recently highlighted the severity of the issue in a report, noting that “electricity demand from AI-driven data centers and advanced manufacturing is rising at a record pace.” The report emphasizes that current approaches to grid management and load addition are insufficient to meet this surge. PJM Interconnection, the largest U.S. power grid operator serving 67 million customers across 13 states, is already feeling the strain. Electricity bills in parts of PJM’s territory are expected to rise by over 20% this summer, with businesses in Pennsylvania facing increases as high as 29%.

The rapid expansion of data centers, particularly in “Data Center Alley” in Northern Virginia, has exacerbated the problem. In PJM’s 2024 power grid auction, the cost for power plant capacity skyrocketed by 800%, jumping from $28.92 per megawatt-day in 2023 to $269.92 in 2024. This spike reflects the intense competition for power as tech giants secure capacity for their energy-hungry AI operations.

## Policy Missteps and Energy Shortfalls

The current crisis has been years in the making, driven by energy policies that have prioritized short-term environmental goals over long-term reliability. Across the country, coal and nuclear power plants—reliable sources of baseload energy—have been shuttered, often replaced with less dependable solar and wind power. For example, New York’s Indian Point Power Plant was closed under former Governor Andrew Cuomo and Lieutenant Governor Kathy Hochul, a decision that has left the state scrambling to meet energy demands. Now, Governor Hochul is reportedly considering new nuclear power plants to address the shortfall.

The premature closure of fossil fuel plants, combined with restrictions on expanding natural gas production—despite the U.S. having abundant reserves—has left the nation vulnerable to supply shortages. PJM’s 2024 annual report cites these state-level energy policies as a significant factor in the current supply-demand imbalance.

## China’s Rapid Power Plant Construction: A Contrast

While the U.S. struggles to meet rising electricity demand, China has taken a markedly different approach, rapidly expanding its power generation capacity to keep pace with its growing energy needs. In 2024 alone, China began construction on 94.5 gigawatts (GW) of new coal-fired power plants, the highest level in a decade, and resumed 3.3 GW of previously suspended projects. Since 2022, China has permitted an average of two large coal power plants per week, with 106 GW permitted in 2022 and 70.2 GW of new construction-initiated in 2023. This aggressive buildout, driven by energy security concerns and coal industry interests, has solidified coal’s role in China’s energy mix, despite its commitments to peak carbon emissions by 2030.

China’s nuclear power sector is also expanding at an unprecedented pace. As of 2024, China operates 58 nuclear power plants with a capacity of 60.88 GW, ranking third globally, and has 27 additional plants under construction, adding 32.31 GW. Since 2000, China has increased its operational nuclear reactors tenfold, with completion times for domestic reactor builds averaging five to seven years. For instance, the Hualong One reactor at Zhangzhou connected to the grid just 61 months after construction began. China’s ability to localize technology, streamline supply chains, and prioritize energy security has enabled it to build nuclear plants faster and more cost-effectively than most Western nations.

This rapid construction stands in stark contrast to the U.S., where regulatory hurdles, prolonged permitting processes, and a lack of cohesive energy policy have slowed power plant development. While China’s coal reliance raises environmental concerns, its ability to meet energy demand offers insights for U.S. policymakers aiming to balance reliability and sustainability.

## The Consequences: Rising Costs and Potential Rationing

The immediate impact of this energy crunch is already being felt in consumers’ wallets. With electricity costs soaring, households and businesses alike are bracing for higher bills. In Pennsylvania, the situation is dire enough that the governor has threatened to abandon PJM’s services if prices cannot be stabilized. Meanwhile, PJM’s CEO, Manu Asthana, announced his resignation effective at the end of 2025, signaling internal turmoil within the organization.

Looking ahead, the combination of skyrocketing demand, an outdated grid, and insufficient new power generation raises the specter of electricity rationing. As policymakers push for widespread adoption of electric vehicles and issue warnings about “extreme heat” while urging consumers to limit air conditioning use, the irony is stark. The infrastructure needed to support these initiatives is simply not in place.

## A Path Forward?

To avert a future of rationing and blackouts, the U.S. must act swiftly to modernize its electrical grid and expand reliable energy generation. This includes investing in new nuclear power plants, which provide consistent, carbon-free energy, and easing restrictions on natural gas development to bridge the gap while renewable technologies mature. Additionally, upgrading the nation’s grid infrastructure is critical to ensuring that power can be delivered efficiently to meet growing demand.

The challenges are immense, but they are not insurmountable. However, they require a pragmatic approach to energy policy—one that balances environmental goals with the need for affordability and reliability. Without swift action, Americans may face a future where electricity is not just more expensive but also rationed, with profound implications for daily life and economic growth.
