excerpt: PJM’s 2026/2027 auction cleared at the FERC price cap of $329.17/MW-day—a 22% jump—amid surging AI demand, retiring coal/gas plants, and grid strain, signaling urgent need for dispatchable power to prevent blackouts and price spikes.

The surge in artificial intelligence (AI) is driving a massive increase in electricity demand, pushing America’s largest power grid, PJM Interconnection, to its limits. Serving 65 million people across 13 states and Washington, D.C., PJM has issued repeated “Maximum Generation” and “Load Management” alerts this summer as heatwaves and AI data centers strain capacity. With no spare power to meet this unprecedented demand, electricity prices are soaring, and the threat of blackouts looms. Here’s why the grid is maxed out and what it means for consumers.

## AI Data Centers: A Power-Hungry Explosion

PJM’s territory includes Loudoun County, Virginia, dubbed “Data Center Alley,” the world’s largest hub for data centers. The rapid buildout of AI facilities is consuming electricity at an alarming rate, with modern server racks like Nvidia’s GB200 drawing 120 kW, double the 60–80 kW of older models. A single hyperscale data center can use 100–300 megawatts, enough to power tens of thousands of homes. The International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasts that global data center electricity use will double by 2026, reaching over 1,000 terawatt-hours, comparable to Japan’s annual consumption.

“There is simply no new capacity to meet new loads,” Joe Bowring, president of Monitoring Analytics, PJM’s independent watchdog, told Bloomberg. He suggests data center operators build their own power generation, as the grid struggles to keep up. This summer’s alerts, triggered by heat-driven air conditioning demand, underscore the system’s fragility as AI compounds the strain.

## Retiring Plants and Decarbonization Challenges

The grid’s capacity crisis is worsened by the retirement of coal and nuclear plants, driven by decarbonization policies. While renewable energy is critical, only 15% of new capacity added in 2024 came from renewables, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), with natural gas and coal filling the gap. Over 20% of PJM’s generating capacity is slated to retire by 2030, leaving the grid vulnerable. In Maryland, officials warn of potential rolling blackouts, noting the state cannot rely solely on imported power to meet demand.

## Escalating Costs: The Capacity Auction Squeeze

PJM’s annual capacity auction, which compensates power producers for ensuring supply, has driven costs to new heights. This year’s auction reached $16.1 billion, up from $14.7 billion last year, with the capacity price per megawatt-day hitting $329.17, compared to $269.92 in 2024. The auction’s price floor ($177.24) and cap ($329.17) cleared at the maximum, prompting criticism of its fairness. Consumers are feeling the pinch, with the EIA reporting a 15% rise in residential electricity prices over five years and projections of 20–30% increases in PJM’s region due to AI-driven demand.

## Who Wins, Who Loses?

Independent power producers like Constellation Energy, Talen Energy, NRG, and Vistra are capitalizing on the demand surge, investing over $34 billion in 2025 to acquire natural gas plants. Natural gas, powering 40% of U.S. electricity, is a key bridge fuel as renewables lag. However, consumers face higher bills, with posts on X highlighting that data center demand accounts for a significant portion of cost increases. Jon Gordon of Advanced Energy United noted that data centers are outpacing the grid’s ability to adapt, deepening supply shortages.

## The Broader Challenge: A Grid on the Brink

The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) warns that PJM’s region risks power shortages by 2027 if demand growth continues unchecked. Data centers could consume 20% of U.S. electricity by 2030, up from 4% today, per McKinsey & Company. Solutions like requiring data centers to generate their own power could fragment the grid, while the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) explores capacity market reforms, a process that may take years.

## Looking Forward: Solutions or Shortages?

Short-term fixes include flexible load strategies, such as Duke University’s Nicholas Institute proposal to unlock 18 GW through brief curtailments. Long-term, the U.S. needs investment in nuclear power, renewables, and grid upgrades. PJM’s Dave Souder noted that 45,000 MW of approved energy projects are stalled by supply chain and permitting issues. Consumers can adopt energy-efficient appliances or join demand response programs, but systemic change is critical to avoid blackouts and unaffordable bills.

The AI revolution is transforming technology but exposing the U.S. grid’s vulnerabilities. Without urgent action, the balance between innovation and energy reliability will tip, leaving consumers to pay the price.
