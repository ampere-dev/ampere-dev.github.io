Amazon is diving headfirst into nuclear energy, announcing a $500 million investment in small modular reactors (SMRs) to fuel its growing data center empire, as reported by The Register. With AI-driven energy demands soaring, the tech giant is partnering with X-energy, Energy Northwest, and Dominion Energy to develop SMR projects aiming for 5 gigawatts of carbon-free power by 2039. This article explores Amazon’s nuclear ambitions, the promise of SMRs, and the challenges ahead. <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/10/16/amazon_nuclear_smr/" target="_blank">Read the full Register article</a>.

### Amazon’s Nuclear Push

Amazon’s investment includes a $500 million Series-C funding round for X-energy, a leader in SMR technology, to accelerate reactor development. The company is also supporting three new nuclear projects, including a feasibility study with Energy Northwest in Washington state and an SMR project near Dominion Energy’s North Anna nuclear station in Virginia. These initiatives aim to deliver reliable, carbon-free energy to meet the surging power needs of AWS data centers. <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/sustainability/amazon-nuclear-energy-projects-small-modular-reactors" target="_blank">Learn more about Amazon’s nuclear strategy</a>.

### The Promise of Small Modular Reactors

SMRs are compact nuclear reactors designed for faster construction and deployment closer to power grids compared to traditional plants. Amazon highlights their potential for “faster build times” and scalability, with X-energy’s Xe-100 reactors targeting 320 megawatts initially, expandable to 960 megawatts—enough to power over 770,000 homes. AWS CEO Matt Garman emphasizes nuclear’s role in achieving Amazon’s net-zero carbon goal by 2040. <a href="https://www.x-energy.com/technology" target="_blank">Explore X-energy’s SMR technology</a>.

### Addressing AI Data Center Energy Demands

The AI boom is pushing data center energy consumption to new heights, with estimates suggesting data centers could account for 9% of U.S. electricity by 2030. Amazon’s SMR projects, alongside its earlier $650 million acquisition of a nuclear-powered data center in Pennsylvania, reflect a strategic shift toward reliable, 24/7 clean energy sources to support AI workloads. <a href="https://www.energytech.com/renewables/article/55112998/data-center-take-on-world-nuclear-day-amazon-is-banking-on-future-reactors" target="_blank">Read about data center energy trends</a>.

### Industry-Wide Nuclear Momentum

Amazon isn’t alone in its nuclear pivot. Google has partnered with Kairos Power for SMRs, Microsoft signed a deal to restart Three Mile Island, and Oracle secured permits for SMR-powered data centers. These moves signal a growing industry consensus that nuclear energy, particularly SMRs, is critical for meeting AI-driven power demands while maintaining sustainability goals. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/16/business/energy-environment/amazon-google-microsoft-nuclear-energy.html" target="_blank">Discover Big Tech’s nuclear investments</a>.

### Challenges and Criticisms

Despite the enthusiasm, SMRs face hurdles. No commercial SMRs are operational in the U.S., with only NuScale’s design approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Critics argue SMRs are costly and produce radioactive waste, while projects like NuScale’s Idaho initiative have collapsed due to financial issues. Regulatory delays and public perception also pose risks. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/amazoncom-joins-push-nuclear-power-meet-data-center-demand-2024-10-16/" target="_blank">Learn about SMR challenges</a>.

### Looking Ahead

Amazon’s SMR investments mark a bold step toward redefining data center power infrastructure. With projects targeting the early 2030s and a goal of 5 gigawatts by 2039, the company is betting on nuclear to bridge the gap between AI growth and sustainability. As regulatory and technical challenges loom, Amazon’s partnerships with X-energy and utilities could set a precedent for the industry. <a href="https://www.ans.org/news/article-5696/amazon-investing-in-smrs-to-deploy-5-gw-by-2039/" target="_blank">Explore Amazon’s 5GW nuclear goal</a>.
