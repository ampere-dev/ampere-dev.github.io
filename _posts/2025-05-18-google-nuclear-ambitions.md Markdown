May 18, 2025

Google is intensifying its push into nuclear energy to meet the soaring power demands of its AI-driven data centers, announcing a strategic partnership with Elementl Power to develop three advanced nuclear sites and a prior deal with Kairos Power for small modular reactors (SMRs). These initiatives aim to deliver over 2.3 gigawatts of clean, reliable energy by 2035, aligning with Google’s net-zero carbon goals. This article explores Google’s nuclear investments, the technology behind SMRs, and the implications for the AI-powered future. <a href="https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/articles/google-to-fund-elementl-to-prepare-three-nuclear-power-sites" target="_blank">Read about Google’s Elementl partnership</a>.

### Google’s Partnership with Elementl Power

Google has committed early-stage capital to Elementl Power, a South Carolina-based nuclear developer, to prepare three U.S. sites for advanced nuclear projects, each capable of generating at least 600 megawatts. This 1.8-gigawatt initiative supports Elementl’s goal of deploying 10 gigawatts by 2035. Google retains the option to purchase power once the sites are operational, ensuring a steady supply for its data centers. The deal, announced in May 2025, underscores Google’s role in financing clean energy to fuel AI innovation. <a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/google-partners-with-elementl-to-support-development-of-three-advanced-nuclear-projects-in-us/" target="_blank">Learn more about the Elementl deal</a>.

### Kairos Power and SMR Innovation

In October 2024, Google signed a landmark agreement with Kairos Power to purchase power from a fleet of SMRs, targeting 500 megawatts by 2035, with the first deployment expected by 2030. Kairos’ fluoride salt-cooled, high-temperature reactors use a molten-salt cooling system and ceramic pebble-type fuel, offering a compact, efficient design. These SMRs promise faster deployment and proximity to data centers, addressing the AI sector’s need for 24/7 carbon-free power. <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/10/15/google_kairos_smr_nuclear_investment/" target="_blank">Explore Google’s Kairos partnership</a>.

### Why Nuclear for AI Data Centers?

Nuclear energy’s appeal lies in its reliability and carbon-free output, critical for AI data centers requiring constant power. Unlike solar or wind, nuclear plants provide stable baseload energy, making them ideal for tech companies with aggressive sustainability goals. Google’s investments align with its goal to mitigate a 48% emissions increase over five years, largely due to AI expansion. Nuclear offers a reliable alternative to fossil fuels, supporting Google’s 2030 carbon-free energy target. <a href="https://www.powermag.com/google-will-fund-three-nuclear-projects-with-elementl-power/" target="_blank">Read about nuclear’s role in AI power</a>.

### Industry-Wide Nuclear Trend

Google joins other tech giants like Amazon, which invested $500 million in X-energy’s SMRs, and Microsoft, which is restarting Three Mile Island, in embracing nuclear energy. Elementl’s “technology-agnostic” approach allows flexibility in choosing reactor designs, potentially leveraging Kairos or other SMR providers. These partnerships reflect a broader industry shift toward nuclear to power AI, with U.S. data center electricity demand projected to rise 130% by 2030. <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/technology/google-announces-agreement-with-company-develop-advanced-nuclear-energy-sites" target="_blank">Discover tech’s nuclear investments</a>.

### Challenges and Opportunities

Advanced nuclear projects face significant hurdles, including regulatory delays, high costs, and public skepticism about safety. No commercial SMRs are operational in the U.S., and past projects, like NuScale’s, have faced cancellations due to cost overruns. However, Google’s funding for permitting, grid connections, and contractor hiring accelerates Elementl’s timeline. The partnership’s focus on utility collaboration and site selection could streamline development, setting a model for future projects. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/09/google-inks-deal-to-develop-1-8-gw-of-advanced-nuclear-power/" target="_blank">Learn about SMR challenges</a>.

### Looking Ahead

Google’s nuclear strategy positions it as a leader in clean energy innovation, with Elementl’s 1.8 gigawatts and Kairos’ 500 megawatts forming a robust pipeline for AI data center power. By 2035, these projects could transform the energy landscape, delivering over 2.3 gigawatts of carbon-free electricity. As AI demand grows, Google’s investments signal confidence in nuclear’s role in a sustainable, tech-driven future. <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/sustainability/elementl-power-collaboration/" target="_blank">Explore Google’s nuclear vision</a>.
