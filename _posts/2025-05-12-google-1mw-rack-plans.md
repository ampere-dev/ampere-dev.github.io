May 12, 2025

Google is pushing the boundaries of data centre design with plans for 1-megawatt (MW) IT racks, leveraging the electric vehicle (EV) supply chain to revolutionize power delivery and cooling infrastructure, as detailed in a May 2025 report by The Register. This ambitious move, unveiled at the Open Compute Project (OCP) EMEA summit, addresses the soaring energy demands of AI workloads. By adopting ±400 VDC power systems and advanced cooling distribution units (CDUs), Google aims to support hyperscale AI processing while navigating significant engineering challenges. This article explores Google’s strategy, the implications of 1 MW racks, and complementary industry developments. <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/05/01/google_details_plans_for_1/" target="_blank">Read the full Register article</a>.

### Google’s 1 MW Rack Vision

At OCP EMEA 2025, Google outlined its plan to design data centre racks capable of supporting 1 MW of IT hardware, a dramatic leap from the 30–100 kW racks common in 2025. This shift is driven by AI’s energy-intensive workloads, particularly for training large language models and generative AI applications. By exploiting the EV supply chain, Google is adopting ±400 VDC power delivery systems, which offer higher efficiency and compatibility with mass-produced EV components. This approach reduces costs and accelerates deployment, but it requires rethinking power infrastructure to handle unprecedented energy densities. <a href="https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/energy-power-supply/data-centers-bypassing-the-grid-to-obtain-the-power-they-need" target="_blank">Explore data centre power trends</a>.

### Rack Density and Future Power Requirements

The move to 1 MW racks reflects a broader industry trend toward extreme rack density, with projections of 1–5 MW per rack in the coming years. Posts on X note that rack power has surged from 10–20 kW in the 2010s to 30–100 kW in 2025, with Google leading the charge toward megawatt-scale designs. Such densities demands advanced cooling solutions, as traditional air cooling is insufficient. Google’s next-generation CDUs, designed for liquid cooling, aim to manage the heat generated by 1 MW racks, potentially requiring megawatts of cooling capacity per rack. This aligns with industry forecasts that AI data centres could consume as much power as small cities by 2030. <a href="https://datacentremagazine.com/hyperscale/the-ai-data-centre-potential-the-urgent-need-for-balance" target="_blank">Learn about AI data centre power demands</a>.

### Cooling Infrastructure Challenges

Cooling 1 MW racks poses significant engineering hurdles. Liquid cooling, already critical for 100 kW racks, becomes non-negotiable at megawatt scales. Google’s CDUs are designed to handle high thermal loads, but scaling to 1 MW requires innovations in coolant flow, heat exchanger efficiency, and system reliability. Industry analyses suggest that direct-to-chip and immersion cooling will dominate, with companies like Nvidia and AMD integrating liquid cooling into GPU designs. The risk of thermal runaway or cooling failures at such power levels also necessitates advanced fire suppression systems, moving beyond oxygen-deprivation methods to address high-energy electrical risks. <a href="https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/cooling/liquid-cooling-ai-data-centers" target="_blank">Discover liquid cooling advancements</a>.

### Power Delivery and EV Supply Chain Integration

Google’s adoption of ±400 VDC power draws inspiration from EV battery systems, which operate at similar voltages. This allows Google to tap into mass-produced components like inverters and power modules, reducing costs and lead times. However, delivering 1 MW per rack requires high-voltage cabling, advanced power distribution units, and grid-scale energy sources. Google’s concurrent investments in nuclear power, including a 1.8 GW deal with Elementl Power for three advanced reactor sites, aim to secure the reliable, carbon-free energy needed for these racks. This strategy mitigates grid constraints, as data centres are projected to consume 9% of U.S. electricity by 2030. <a href="https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/articles/google-to-fund-elementl-to-prepare-three-nuclear-power-sites" target="_blank">Read about Google’s nuclear investments</a>.

### Industry-Wide Implications

Google’s 1 MW rack plans set a precedent for the industry, with competitors like Amazon and Microsoft also scaling infrastructure for AI. Amazon’s $100 billion 2025 investment in AI data centres and Microsoft’s Three Mile Island restart reflect similar ambitions. However, the shift to megawatt racks raises safety and regulatory concerns. Forums on The Register highlight parallels to the 19th-century railway boom, warning of “explosive” risks if engineering standards lag. The industry must balance innovation with robust safety protocols to prevent incidents at high-energy facilities. <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/09/20/three_mile_island_nuclear_plant_microsoft_ai/" target="_blank">Explore Microsoft’s nuclear deal</a>.

### Challenges and Risks

Implementing 1 MW racks involves significant challenges. Power infrastructure must handle extreme current loads, requiring costly upgrades to transformers and cabling. Cooling systems face scalability limits, with potential bottlenecks in coolant supply or heat dissipation. Regulatory hurdles, including fire safety and grid interconnection standards, could delay deployments. Additionally, the speculative nature of hyperscale buildouts risks overcapacity if AI demand doesn’t match projections, as noted by Moody’s Ratings. Strategic planning and modular designs will be critical to mitigate these risks. <a href="https://datacentremagazine.com/hyperscale/the-ai-data-centre-potential-the-urgent-need-for-balance" target="_blank">Learn about hyperscale risks</a>.

### Looking Ahead

Google’s 1 MW rack plans signal a transformative shift in data centre design, driven by AI’s relentless growth. By leveraging EV supply chains, nuclear power, and advanced cooling, Google aims to sustain its leadership in AI infrastructure. As rack densities approaches 1–5 MW, the industry must innovate rapidly to address power, cooling, and safety challenges. Projects like Google’s Mesa, Arizona, data centre and nuclear partnerships will shape the future of sustainable AI computing. The success of these megawatt-scale racks could redefine how data centres power the AI revolution. <a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/google-breaks-ground-on-first-arizona-data-center-in-mesa/" target="_blank">Discover Google’s Arizona data centre</a>.
