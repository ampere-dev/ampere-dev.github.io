Despite rumors of a slowdown, North America’s data center sector is surging in 2025, fueled by AI’s insatiable demand for computing power. A June 2025 industry report highlights major land acquisitions and projects by Amazon Web Services (AWS), NTT, and others, with significant developments in Arizona, Texas, and Canada. AWS CEO Matt Garman confirmed the company’s aggressive expansion, while NTT acquired land in Hillsboro, Oregon, and Phoenix, Arizona. This article explores key North American data center projects, their power demands, renewable energy integration, and grid resilience challenges, focusing on the AI-driven growth in the U.S. and Canada.

## Amazon Web Services: Sustaining Breakneck Growth

AWS is accelerating its data center expansion to meet AI capacity needs, with CEO Matt Garman dismissing slowdown rumors. In North America, AWS is investing heavily in Texas, where it plans a data center in Round Rock, complementing its global push in Chile, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia, and Taiwan. These facilities will support AI workloads requiring 1–5 MW per rack, with outages costing millions per hour, per Uptime Institute estimates. AWS’s focus on scalable infrastructure aligns with a 23% annual data center demand growth through 2030, per JLL, ensuring cloud services remain robust.

## NTT’s Strategic Land Acquisitions

NTT, a global technology services provider, announced a blockbuster land acquisition in June 2025, expanding its North American footprint in Hillsboro, Oregon, and Phoenix, Arizona. These sites will bolster NTT’s existing 1,500 MW global capacity, supporting AI and cloud computing. In Phoenix, NTT’s expansion aligns with Arizona’s data center boom, driven by low power costs ($0.06–$0.069 per kWh). The company’s investments reflect a strategic response to AI’s power-intensive demands, with facilities designed for high-density computing.

## Arizona: A Data Center Hotspot

Arizona’s Phoenix Valley is a prime data center hub, with projects like Novva Data Centers’ Project Borealis in Mesa, targeting 300 MW across five facilities by 2026, starting with a 96 MW phase. EdgeCore Digital acquired 44 acres in Mesa to deliver 450 MW for hyperscale clients, while Chamath Palihapitiya’s $51 million investment in Hassayampa Ranch aims for a 1,500 MW megasite west of Phoenix. These projects leverage Arizona’s solar potential but face water scarcity, consuming 905 million gallons annually. Medium voltage load banks, using three cables, test substation settings, ensuring reliability.

## Texas: Massive Scale and AI Focus

Texas is a data center powerhouse, with Tract’s 1,515-acre acquisition in Caldwell County, between Austin and San Antonio, supporting over 2 GW at full build-out. In Abilene, Crusoe, Blue Owl Capital, and Primary Digital Infrastructure’s $15 billion joint venture advances a 1.2 GW data center, with six new buildings set for 2026. AWS’s Round Rock project and OpenAI’s Stargate, a $500 billion AI facility, underscore Texas’s appeal, driven by land availability and power infrastructure. Load bank testing mitigates grid risks, per NFPA 110 standards.

## Canada: Emerging AI Data Center Frontier

In Canada, BCE, the nation’s largest telecom, is investing hundreds of millions to build AI data centers in six cities, starting in Kamloops, British Columbia, with plans for Manitoba and Quebec, totaling 500 MW. Beacon AI Data Centers, led by new CEO Josh Schertzer, aims to energize sites in Alberta by 2027, leveraging the province’s energy resources. These projects, supported by Stantec’s engineering, will create 1,200 permanent jobs, per industry estimates, positioning Canada as a digital economy leader.

## Renewable Energy Integration

Data centers’ 1.5% global electricity share is driving renewable adoption. In Missouri, Arevon Energy’s Kelso 1 and 2 solar projects, supplying Meta with 430 MW, exemplify this trend. Florida’s Zeo Energy acquired Heliogen to enhance solar for industrial-scale facilities. Analyst Christopher Tozzi notes solar’s declining costs but cautions its weather-dependent limitations, suggesting a hybrid approach with nuclear, as seen in Microsoft’s Three Mile Island revival. These efforts align with Google’s 2030 carbon-free goal, reducing data centers’ environmental footprint.

## Grid Resilience and Power Challenges

North America’s data center boom, with a projected 6.17% CAGR to $201.8 billion by 2032, strains grids, facing a ~50 GW U.S. deficit by 2035, per NERC. High-voltage cable shortages, with 2029 lead times, and limited transmission upgrades (1,000 miles annually) pose risks. Medium voltage load banks, streamlining substation testing with three cables, verify settings, reducing outages by 15%. Projects like Stargate and Hassayampa Ranch, requiring gigawatts, highlight the need for nuclear and solar to ensure stability.

## Economic Impacts

Each data center project adds $243.5 million to local economies, creating 1,688 construction jobs and 157 permanent roles, generating $32.5 million annually and $1.1 million in taxes, per Upwind’s analysis. In Texas, Tract’s Caldwell project and Crusoe’s Abilene venture boost employment, while Canada’s BCE initiative supports 500 MW of economic activity. Arizona’s developments, like Project Borealis, drive tax revenue, but water and power constraints require careful planning to sustain growth.

## Looking Ahead

North America’s data center sector is thriving, with AWS, NTT, and others leading expansions in Arizona, Texas, and Canada to meet AI’s 23% annual demand growth. Projects like Stargate, Project Borealis, and BCE’s Canadian hubs underscore the scale, with gigawatts of capacity planned. Renewable energy, nuclear investments, and efficient testing with load banks address a ~50 GW grid deficit and environmental concerns. As hubs like Phoenix and Alberta grow, strategic infrastructure will secure a resilient, AI-ready digital future.
