# Transformer Shortages: Reshoring Challenges Threaten U.S. Grid and AI Data Centers

**May 24, 2025**

A May 21, 2025 T&D World article by Jeff Postelwait details the intensifying U.S. transformer shortage, exposing deeper structural obstacles to reshoring critical grid components. Lead times have ballooned to 120+ weeks, prices have multiplied 4–9×, and domestic manufacturers like MGM Transformer Company and VanTran Transformers—while expanding—are constrained by labor shortages, specialized material scarcity, and logistics bottlenecks. As AI data centers drive explosive demand and the grid contends with aging infrastructure and a ~50 GW projected shortfall, accelerating domestic production is essential for resilience and energy security. This article examines the crisis, MGM/VanTran’s contributions, reshoring barriers, proposed remedies, and the path to a more self-reliant grid.

## The Transformer Shortage Crisis

Large power and distribution transformers are the backbone of voltage transformation and grid stability, yet the U.S. faces severe supply constraints. Pre-COVID lead times of 12–14 weeks have stretched to 2–3 years or more, with costs soaring due to raw material tightness (especially grain-oriented electrical steel—GOES), skilled labor shortages, and global shipping/logistics disruptions. The surge in AI data center builds—projected to consume up to 9% of U.S. electricity by 2030—has dramatically increased demand, delaying utility upgrades, electrification projects, and new connections. The National Infrastructure Advisory Council (NIAC) and DOE assessments warn that prolonged shortages risk reliability and economic growth unless domestic capacity scales rapidly.

## MGM/VanTran Transformers’ Role

MGM Transformer (California) and VanTran Transformers (Texas) are among the few U.S.-based manufacturers capable of producing medium- and high-voltage units at meaningful scale. MGM focuses on custom distribution transformers for utilities and data centers, while VanTran specializes in pad-mount, substation, and specialty designs suited to high-reliability environments. Both have invested in expansion—MGM added a 50,000 sq ft facility in 2024, and VanTran is planning additional capacity for 2026—but face the same industry-wide constraints: workforce gaps, GOES supply limits (only one major U.S. producer), and long lead times for capital equipment. Their output is vital for bridging the gap while broader reshoring efforts mature.

## Impact on AI Data Centers

Hyperscale AI facilities (e.g., xAI’s Colossus, OpenAI’s Stargate) require reliable, high-capacity transformers to step down utility voltage for multi-megawatt campuses and handle 1–5 MW rack densities. Shortages delay site energization, increase project costs, and heighten outage risk—Uptime Institute data shows power failures already cause ~40% of major incidents, with transformer issues contributing significantly. Load bank testing (NFPA 110) validates backup systems under AI loads, but without sufficient transformers, utilities cannot support new connections or expansions fast enough. McKinsey and DOE forecasts indicate AI-driven demand could require 160–260% more transformer capacity by 2030–2050, making domestic supply a make-or-break factor.

## Reshoring Challenges

Reshoring transformer manufacturing is far more complex than policy rhetoric suggests. The industry’s ~15,000-person workforce must roughly triple to meet net-zero and AI pathways (per NREL), but training cycles are long and turnover high. GOES, which constitutes ~25% of transformer cost, remains bottlenecked with limited U.S. production. Tariffs on Chinese imports—intended to incentivize domestic growth—have instead raised input costs for U.S. manufacturers. Logistics for massive units (railcar availability, 18-month waits) add further delays. New facilities (e.g., Maddox Transformer’s recent expansion) take 12–36 months to reach full output, leaving a multi-year gap that threatens grid and data-center timelines.

## Grid Resilience and Energy Security

Aging transformers (70%+ over 25 years old) combined with shortages create a double vulnerability: slow replacement after failures and inability to add capacity for growing loads. Cyber threats (Volt Typhoon-style campaigns) and physical attacks on substations amplify risks. NIAC’s proposed “virtual transformer reserve”—where the government acts as buyer of last resort—could stabilize orders for MGM/VanTran and similar firms. Smart transformers (GE Vernova FITT-funded designs) with IoT monitoring enable predictive maintenance and faster fault isolation. Domestic production shortens supply chains, reduces geopolitical exposure, and pairs with nuclear baseload (Velvet-Wood uranium, Three Mile Island restart) to ensure reliable power for AI and critical infrastructure.

## Proposed Solutions

Coordinated action is urgently needed:

- DOE’s FITT and TRAC programs fund advanced designs (solid-state transformers—SSTs—from Transforma Energy and others) that improve efficiency, reduce size, and ease material demands.
- Federal workforce incentives and accelerated training (modeled on utility and community college partnerships) to scale skilled labor.
- Long-term utility purchase agreements to provide revenue certainty for MGM/VanTran and peers.
- Refurbishment programs (e.g., JEA Florida) to extend life of existing units.
- Public-private procurement guarantees (similar to Canadian models) to de-risk new factory builds.

These steps, combined with strategic reserves and innovation, can narrow the supply-demand gap.

## Future Outlook

The transformer market remains structurally imbalanced—demand far outstrips supply through at least 2027. Investments from Eaton, ProlecGE ($165M+), and domestic players like MGM/VanTran signal progress, but normalization requires sustained policy support. AI-optimized monitoring, load bank validation, and SST/mobile transformer adoption will improve utilization of existing assets. DOE’s push for federal-land data centers and nuclear co-location will further drive need—and opportunity—for U.S.-made transformers. By 2030, a strengthened domestic supply chain could meet the projected 260% capacity growth, securing grid reliability for AI, renewables integration, and national resilience.

## Looking Ahead

The transformer shortage, as T&D World illustrates, is a stark warning of reshoring’s real-world difficulties. MGM and VanTran Transformers are on the front lines, yet systemic labor, material, and logistical barriers persist. AI data centers and grid modernization cannot wait—solutions like FITT-funded innovation, workforce scaling, virtual reserves, and long-term contracts must move with urgency. Annual load bank testing and smart-grid technologies will maintain performance in the interim, while nuclear expansion provides the baseload foundation. With Apollo-scale commitment, the U.S. can overcome these challenges, forging a self-reliant, resilient grid that powers AI leadership and energy security for decades.
