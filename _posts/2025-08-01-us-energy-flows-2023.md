The United States’ energy landscape is undergoing a profound transformation, as detailed in the 2023 U.S. energy flow chart released by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL). These charts, known as Sankey diagrams, have been a cornerstone of energy analysis since the 1970s, offering a visual representation of the nation’s energy production, consumption, and waste. The 2023 chart, available at flowcharts.llnl.gov, reveals a total energy consumption of 93.6 quadrillion British Thermal Units (BTUs), or quads, with significant shifts toward cleaner energy sources and a reduction in fossil fuel use, signaling progress in the nation’s decarbonization efforts.

## Understanding the 2023 Energy Flow Chart

LLNL’s Sankey diagrams are single-page visualizations that map the flow of energy from sources—such as solar, nuclear, hydroelectric, wind, geothermal, natural gas, coal, biomass, and petroleum—to their end uses in residential, commercial, industrial, and transportation sectors. The 2023 chart shows that of the 93.6 quads consumed, approximately 60% (56.2 quads) was wasted as “rejected energy” due to inefficiencies in power plants, vehicles, and buildings, while 37.4 quads were converted into useful energy services. This persistent inefficiency underscores the need for advanced technologies to optimize energy use.

The chart highlights a notable trend: Americans reduced their consumption of electricity and fossil fuels in 2023 compared to previous years, while increasing reliance on carbon-free energy sources like solar, wind, and nuclear. For instance, solar and wind power saw significant gains, with solar increasing by 23% and wind by 5% from 2021 to 2023, reflecting broader adoption of renewables across the energy supply sector.

## Shifting Energy Sources: A Move Toward Renewables

The 2023 data illustrates a continued pivot away from fossil fuels. Natural gas remained a dominant source, contributing 32.6 quads, primarily for electricity generation and industrial use, but its share has slightly declined. Coal usage dropped to 11.9 quads, a significant decrease from its 2019 peak of 15.7 quads, driven by the retirement of coal-fired power plants. Petroleum, used heavily in transportation (26.8 quads), also saw a modest reduction. Meanwhile, renewable energy sources are gaining ground: solar contributed 2.1 quads, wind 3.8 quads, and hydroelectric 2.4 quads, collectively accounting for over 10% of the energy mix. Nuclear power, providing 8.1 quads, remains a steady source of carbon-free electricity.

This shift aligns with broader decarbonization trends. According to an LLNL news release, the nation’s carbon dioxide emissions decreased in 2023, driven by increased renewable energy adoption and reduced fossil fuel consumption. However, state-level trends vary, with states like California and Texas showing significant solar growth (21% and 57% increases from 2016 to 2017, respectively), while others lag in transitioning to cleaner sources.

## The Role of Sankey Diagrams in Energy Analysis

Since the mid-1970s, LLNL has produced Sankey diagrams to help scientists, policymakers, and the public understand the complex interrelationships in energy systems. These diagrams, built on data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), use proportional arrows to depict energy flows, with the width of each arrow indicating the magnitude of energy transfer. For example, the 2023 chart shows that 9.99 quads of natural gas were used for electricity generation, while only 0.5 quads powered transportation, highlighting the fuel’s distinct role in the economy.

Beyond energy, LLNL has expanded its flow charts to include carbon and water flows at national, state, and organizational levels, providing critical insights for resource management. These tools are widely used by federal and state agencies, energy researchers, educators, and industry leaders to identify inefficiencies, underused resources, and opportunities for technological advancements.

## Challenges and Opportunities in the Energy Transition

Despite progress, the 2023 chart reveals persistent challenges. The high level of rejected energy (56.2 quads) highlights inefficiencies in current technologies, particularly in power generation and transportation. For instance, only 30% of energy used in electricity generation is converted to useful services, with the rest lost as heat. This inefficiency is compounded by the growing energy demands of AI-driven data centers, which are projected to double global electricity consumption by 2026. In the U.S., data centers in regions like Northern Virginia’s “Data Center Alley” are straining grids, with PJM Interconnection reporting an 800% spike in power capacity costs in 2024 due to hyperscaler demand.

To address these challenges, investments in grid modernization and renewable energy are critical. The U.S. Department of Energy estimates that upgrading aging infrastructure—70% of transmission lines are over 25 years old—could reduce energy waste and support the integration of renewables. Innovations like high-voltage DC power delivery and liquid cooling for data centers are also essential to meet the needs of high-density computing environments.

## Looking Ahead: A Path to Sustainability

The 2023 LLNL energy flow chart underscores the U.S.’s progress toward a decarbonized energy system, with renewables and nuclear power playing larger roles. However, achieving a sustainable future requires addressing inefficiencies, accelerating the deployment of clean energy technologies, and modernizing the grid to handle rising demands from AI, electric vehicles, and electrification. By leveraging insights from Sankey diagrams, policymakers and industry leaders can prioritize investments in energy efficiency, renewable capacity, and resilient infrastructure to ensure a reliable and sustainable energy future.
