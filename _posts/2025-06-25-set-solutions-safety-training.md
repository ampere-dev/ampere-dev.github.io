Attending a safety training seminar led by Pam Tompkins, President and CEO of SET Solutions, was a transformative experience that underscored the critical importance of workplace safety in the electric power industry. With over 40 years of expertise, Pam’s passion for the trade and her steadfast commitment to worker safety were evident throughout the session. The seminar, aligned with SET Solutions’ mission to provide specialized assessment, consulting, and training services, covered essential topics such as OSHA 29 CFR 1910.269 compliance, hazard identification, and human performance improvement. Pam’s dynamic teaching approach, blending real-world scenarios with actionable strategies, made complex safety concepts engaging and practical, empowering attendees to implement robust safety systems in their workplaces.

Pam’s global consulting experience, as showcased on SET Solutions’ podcast page (setsolutionsllc.com/podcasts), brought unparalleled depth to the training. She expertly wove insights from her “Safety By Design” series and human performance assessments, illustrating how “error precursors and traps” can impact decision-making and lead to operational disruptions. The seminar emphasized eliminating “Compliance Grungs”—practices that undermine safety culture—and explored risk assessment techniques to foster accountability in safety leadership.
