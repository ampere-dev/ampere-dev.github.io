As artificial intelligence (AI) drives unprecedented energy demands, tech giants are bypassing traditional power grids to secure reliable, carbon-free energy for their data centers. Microsoft’s deal to restart Three Mile Island’s Unit 1 and Amazon’s nuclear-powered data center acquisitions highlight a growing trend of direct nuclear energy procurement. This article explores how data centers are leveraging nuclear power to meet AI’s energy needs, the challenges of grid reliability, and the implications for the energy landscape. <a href="https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/energy-power-supply/data-centers-bypassing-the-grid-to-obtain-the-power-they-need" target="_blank">Read more on grid bypass trends</a>.

### Microsoft’s Three Mile Island Revival

Microsoft has signed a 20-year agreement with Constellation Energy to restart Three Mile Island’s Unit 1, a nuclear reactor shuttered in 2019 for economic reasons, to power its AI data centers. Renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center, the 837-megawatt facility is expected to come online by 2028, supplying carbon-free energy to Microsoft’s data centers across Pennsylvania, Chicago, Virginia, and Ohio. This deal, the first U.S. nuclear reactor restart, aims to support Microsoft’s goal of becoming carbon negative by 2030. <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/09/20/three_mile_island_nuclear_plant_microsoft_ai/" target="_blank">Learn about the Microsoft-Constellation deal</a>.

### Bypassing the Grid: A Growing Trend

Data centers are increasingly seeking direct power sources to avoid grid constraints. Amazon’s $650 million purchase of a data center campus next to the Susquehanna nuclear plant in Pennsylvania allows it to draw up to 960 megawatts directly from the facility, bypassing the grid. However, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) blocked Amazon’s request for additional direct power, citing risks to grid reliability and consumer costs. This trend reflects the immense energy needs of AI, with data centers projected to consume 9% of U.S. electricity by 2030. <a href="https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/amazon/amazon-buys-nuclear-powered-data-center-pennsylvania-650m" target="_blank">Explore Amazon’s nuclear data center acquisition</a>.

### Why Nuclear Power?

Nuclear energy’s appeal lies in its reliability and carbon-free output, critical for AI data centers requiring constant power. Unlike solar or wind, nuclear plants provide stable baseload energy, making them ideal for tech companies with aggressive sustainability goals. Microsoft’s Three Mile Island deal and Amazon’s Susquehanna project underscore nuclear’s role in meeting these demands. Industry experts note that nuclear restarts, like Three Mile Island and Michigan’s Palisades plant, are faster and cheaper than building new reactors. <a href="https://www.powermag.com/microsoft-would-restart-three-mile-island-nuclear-plant-to-power-ai/" target="_blank">Read about nuclear’s role in AI power</a>.

### Challenges and Regulatory Hurdles

Bypassing the grid raises concerns about equity and grid stability. FERC’s rejection of Amazon’s direct power request highlights fears that tech giants’ energy demands could raise costs for other consumers or strain the grid. Microsoft’s Three Mile Island restart requires significant upgrades—turbines, generators, and cooling systems—and Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) approval, with a review process expected to conclude by 2027. Critics also point to nuclear’s high costs and unresolved waste storage issues. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/amazoncom-joins-push-nuclear-power-meet-data-center-demand-2024-10-16/" target="_blank">Discover nuclear energy challenges</a>.

### Economic and Environmental Impacts

The Three Mile Island restart is projected to create 3,400 jobs and contribute $16 billion to Pennsylvania’s GDP, alongside $3 billion in taxes, according to Constellation. Nuclear power supports tech companies’ decarbonization goals, but critics argue that monopolizing clean energy could limit access for other sectors. Environmental advocates stress the need for sustainable AI practices beyond nuclear reliance, citing the long-term challenges of radioactive waste. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/09/20/microsoft-three-mile-island-nuclear-deal/" target="_blank">Learn about the economic impacts</a>.

### Looking Ahead

The shift toward nuclear-powered data centers signals a new era for energy procurement. As AI continues to drive power demands, tech giants like Microsoft, Amazon, and others are investing in nuclear restarts and small modular reactors (SMRs) to secure reliable energy. While these efforts align with climate goals, balancing grid reliability, consumer costs, and environmental concerns will be critical. The success of projects like Three Mile Island could redefine how data centers power the AI revolution. <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/09/26/1104598/why-microsoft-made-a-deal-to-help-restart-three-mile-island/" target="_blank">Explore the future of nuclear-powered data centers</a>.
