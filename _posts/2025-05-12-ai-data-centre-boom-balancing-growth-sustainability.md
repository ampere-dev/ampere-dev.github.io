The global AI boom is driving an unprecedented surge in hyperscale data centre development, with Moody’s Ratings forecasting a 20% annual capacity increase after 2028. However, this rapid expansion comes with significant technical, financial, and sustainability challenges, as outlined in Data Centre Magazine’s report, “The AI Data Centre Potential: The Urgent Need for Balance.” From escalating rack densities to geopolitical trade tensions, the industry must navigate a complex landscape to sustain growth. This article explores the opportunities, risks, and future power demands shaping AI data centres. <a href="https://datacentremagazine.com/hyperscale/the-ai-data-centre-potential-the-urgent-need-for-balance" target="_blank">Read the full Data Centre Magazine report</a>.

### AI-Driven Hyperscale Expansion

The rise of AI, particularly generative AI, is transforming data centre infrastructure. Hyperscalers like Meta, OpenAI, and others are building massive campuses, such as the 5.6GW Wonder Valley project in Alberta and Meta’s 2GW Louisiana site, to centralize gigawatts of computing power. These facilities, designed to handle AI’s intensive workloads, are projected to add multiple gigawatts by 2029. However, Moody’s warns that much of this capacity is speculative, built in anticipation of future needs, risking overbuild if demand doesn’t align. <a href="https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/data-center-construction/new-data-center-developments-may-2025" target="_blank">Explore recent hyperscale projects</a>.

### Rack Density and Future Power Requirements

AI data centres are pushing rack density to new heights, with current designs reaching 130 kilowatts per rack and projections of 1–5 megawatts per rack in the coming years. Posts on X highlight this trend, noting that average rack density has surged from 10–20 kW in the 2010s to 30–100 kW in 2025, with Google designing for 1MW racks. These extreme power demands require advanced cooling systems, such as liquid cooling, and robust power infrastructure, potentially consuming as much electricity as a medium-sized city. Meeting 1–5MW per rack will necessitate innovative energy solutions, including nuclear power and energy storage systems, to avoid grid strain. <a href="https://www.datacenterfrontier.com/energy/article/11429511/power-constraints-challenge-data-center-growth" target="_blank">Learn about power constraints</a>.

### Supply Chain and Trade Challenges

Geopolitical tensions, particularly U.S. tariffs on materials like structural steel and rare earth minerals, are disrupting data centre supply chains. Moody’s notes that these tariffs increase costs and delay projects, as developers reassess budgets and timelines. Rising prices for critical electrical components further complicate bringing new capacity online, potentially squeezing profit margins for hyperscalers. The report emphasizes that abrupt policy changes create uncertainty, making cost forecasting difficult. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/amazoncom-joins-push-nuclear-power-meet-data-center-demand-2024-10-16/" target="_blank">Read about supply chain impacts</a>.
