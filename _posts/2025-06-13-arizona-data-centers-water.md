A April 2, 2025, Circle of Blue article highlights the rising water demands of data centers in Arizona, a small but growing factor in the state’s water budget. As the Phoenix Valley emerges as a major data center hub, driven by AI and cloud computing, projects like Tract’s Buckeye Tech Corridor are reshaping land use and straining water resources in one of the driest regions of the U.S. With Arizona’s data centers projected to consume 905 million gallons of water in 2025, this article explores their impact, regulatory guardrails, technological innovations, and the broader implications for water management in a drought-prone state.

## Data Centers Reshaping Arizona’s Landscape

In Buckeye, Arizona, a 2,069-acre parcel originally planned for 9,700 homes under the Cipriani community was sold in August 2024 to Tract, a Denver-based data center developer. Now part of the Buckeye Tech Corridor, the site will host up to 20 million square feet of commercial space for cloud computing, reflecting a shift from housing to tech infrastructure. Maricopa County, encompassing metro Phoenix, is one of the U.S.’s largest data center markets, with 164 facilities driven by cheap land, low power rates ($0.06–$0.069 per kWh), tax incentives, and proximity to 5 million residents. This growth, fueled by AI’s computational demands, raises concerns about water use in a region facing a megadrought.

## Water Consumption: A Growing Concern

Bluefield Research estimates Arizona’s data centers will consume 905 million gallons (2,777 acre-feet) of water in 2025, a modest amount compared to agriculture but significant for local utilities. Data centers use water primarily for cooling servers, with evaporative systems consuming over half the water, which escapes into the atmosphere. Nationally, data center water use is surging, turning “drops into a flood,” as individual facilities become more efficient but overall demand accelerates. In Arizona, where groundwater is over-allocated and the Colorado River’s supply has dwindled, this growth pressures finite resources, prompting scrutiny from communities and regulators.

## Regulatory Guardrails and Unequal Treatment

Arizona encourages data center growth through a 2013 sales tax exemption, benefiting 64 facilities, but has implemented guardrails. Chandler’s 2022 ordinance regulates siting and noise but limits water use via a 2015 policy, capping facilities at 115 gallons per day per 1,000 square feet, requiring external sources for excess needs. Marana’s December 2024 ordinance bans potable water use for data centers, reflecting water scarcity concerns. Unlike housing developments, which must recharge groundwater, data centers in areas without renewable surface water face fewer restrictions, fueling complaints from the homebuilding lobby about unequal treatment, as industrial users like Tract’s projects bypass stringent rules.

## Technological Innovations: Zero-Water Solutions

Data centers are adopting water-efficient technologies to mitigate their impact. Closed-loop cooling systems, like those proposed by Microsoft in Mount Pleasant, recycle water, reducing consumption compared to evaporative systems. Adiabatic cooling, using outside air when temperatures are below 85°F, cuts water use but is less effective in Arizona’s blistering heat, often exceeding 113°F. Companies like Google and Meta are investing in water conservation, with Microsoft aiming for “zero-water” cooling in its Arizona facilities by 2021, though high temperatures limit efficacy. These innovations, paired with renewable energy like Arizona’s abundant solar, align with sustainability goals but cannot fully offset demand.

## Water vs. Energy: A Dual Challenge

Glenn Williamson, CEO of the Canada Arizona Business Council, emphasizes energy as a greater concern than water, noting that water solutions are known but require action. Data centers’ energy demands, potentially 16.5% of Arizona’s electricity by 2030, strain utilities like APS and SRP, which rely on a 47% carbon-free mix. Medium voltage load banks, using a three-cable connection, test substation relay settings, ensuring reliable power delivery and reducing commissioning time by 25%. However, water remains a critical issue, with local utilities like Buckeye facing pressure from data centers’ 905 million gallon demand, equivalent to a city of 30,000–50,000 people.

## Community and Environmental Impacts

Data centers offer economic benefits, creating high-tech jobs and boosting supply chains, but their environmental footprint sparks debate. Unlike agriculture, they use less water but compete with communities in water-scarce areas. Non-disclosure agreements obscure water usage details, fueling public distrust, as seen in Mesa’s halt on data center recruitment. In northern Virginia, the largest U.S. data center market, similar concerns highlight land and resource conflicts. Arizona’s rapid growth, with 3 million more residents expected by 2035, amplifies these tensions, as groundwater depletion looms in areas like Phoenix, per a 2025 hydrologist forecast.

## Future Outlook: Balancing Growth and Scarcity

Arizona’s data center market is set to double by 2030, driven by AI’s computational needs. The Arizona Corporation Commission’s 2025 review of energy demands could lead to policies mandating on-site power, like small modular reactors (SMRs), or enhanced renewable-battery systems. Water management strategies, including stricter ordinances and zero-water cooling, will be crucial. Load bank testing ensures grid reliability, supporting projects like Tract’s Buckeye campus. By 2060, extreme heat and water scarcity could challenge Phoenix’s habitability, making sustainable data center practices essential for Arizona’s desert economy.
