The rapid expansion of data centers, driven by the AI boom, is pushing America’s largest power grid to its breaking point. PJM Interconnection, serving 65 million people across 13 states from Virginia to Illinois, lacks the capacity to support new data centers, according to Monitoring Analytics, the grid’s independent watchdog. In a significant escalation, their latest quarterly report recommends that large data centers be required to generate their own power, signaling a critical shift in how the industry must address its soaring energy demands.

### A Grid Under Siege: The Data Center Surge

PJM’s grid, home to the highest concentration of data centers in the U.S., is buckling under the unprecedented power demands of AI-driven facilities, particularly in Northern Virginia’s “Data Center Alley.” Modern AI server racks, such as Nvidia’s GB200, consume 120 kW—double the power of older models—leading to hyperscale data centers requiring 100–300 megawatts, enough to power small cities. The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects global data center electricity consumption will double by 2026, reaching over 1,000 terawatt-hours, comparable to Japan’s annual energy use. In the U.S., data centers could account for 20% of electricity by 2030, up from 4% today, according to McKinsey & Company. <a href="https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/energy-power-supply/data-centers-need-own-power-supply-us-grid-watchdog-says"></a>

“The current supply of capacity in PJM is not adequate to meet the demand from large data center loads and will not be adequate in the foreseeable future,” Monitoring Analytics stated in its August 14 report. Joe Bowring, president of the watchdog, emphasized, “There is simply no new capacity to meet new loads,” urging data center developers to build their own power plants to avoid overwhelming the grid. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-14/data-centers-need-to-bring-own-power-supply-grid-watchdog-says"></a>

### From Suggestion to Mandate: A Policy Shift

Just a month ago, Monitoring Analytics suggested that data center operators consider building their own generation. The latest report takes a firmer stance, recommending a requirement for large data centers to provide their own power. This shift reflects the severity of the crisis, as PJM’s aging infrastructure struggles to keep up with demand, driving up costs for consumers and sparking political controversy. The grid operator reported $16.1 billion in capacity costs for 2026, up from $14.7 billion last year, with prices per megawatt-day hitting a record $329.17. <a href="https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/energy-power-supply/data-centers-need-own-power-supply-us-grid-watchdog-says"></a>

PJM acknowledged the challenge, stating it is working with stakeholders to address the supply-demand imbalance driven by “unprecedented growth in electricity use.” Without action, the watchdog warns, other PJM customers could face “very high costs” as data centers strain the system further.

### Why the Grid Can’t Cope

The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) notes that only 15% of new electricity capacity in 2024 came from renewables, with natural gas and coal filling the gap as coal and nuclear plants retire. Over 20% of PJM’s generating capacity is set to retire by 2030, exacerbating the shortage. The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) projects a high risk of power shortages in PJM’s region by 2027 if demand continues to outpace supply. Data centers could account for 20% of U.S. electricity by 2030, up from 4% today, according to McKinsey & Company. <a href="https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/energy-power-supply/data-centers-need-own-power-supply-us-grid-watchdog-says"></a>

In Maryland, officials have warned of potential rolling blackouts, unable to rely solely on imported power. Pennsylvania recently intervened to stabilize Maryland’s grid, highlighting regional vulnerabilities. The surge in demand, coupled with grid connection delays averaging four years, is pushing operators to seek alternative solutions. <a href="https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/energy-power-supply/data-centers-need-own-power-supply-us-grid-watchdog-says"></a>

### Emerging Solutions: On-Site Power and Beyond

Data center operators are exploring behind-the-meter (BTM) solutions to bypass grid constraints. Natural gas turbines, which can deliver power within months, are gaining traction, as are trailer-mounted generators and liquefied natural gas (LNG) deliveries, which can provide 5–100 MW for continuous or backup needs. JLL reports that powered-land sites with pre-existing infrastructure and retrofitting facilities with stranded power are also viable short-term fixes. <a href="https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/energy-power-supply/record-breaking-data-center-demand-collides-critical-grid-limitations"></a>

Looking ahead, small modular reactors (SMRs) offer a promising long-term solution. Projects like Virginia Green Energy Partners’ plan to use four to six SMRs to power 20–30 data centers highlight nuclear’s potential for scalable, carbon-neutral energy by 2030. Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) paired with renewables are also emerging, enabling data centers to store excess energy and reduce grid reliance. <a href="https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/energy-power-supply/us-energy-experts-highlight-potential-nuclear-powered-data-centers"></a>

### Market Impacts and Consumer Costs

The data center boom is driving investment, with $13.4 billion in asset-backed securities and loans in the first half of 2025, per JLL. However, consumers are bearing the cost, with electricity prices up 15% over five years and projected to rise 20–30% in PJM’s region. Posts on X reflect growing concern, with users noting that data center demand significantly contributes to cost increases. Without intervention, the watchdog warns, these costs could escalate further, impacting households and businesses. <a href="https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/energy-power-supply/record-breaking-data-center-demand-collides-critical-grid-limitations"></a>

### The Path Forward

Addressing the crisis requires a multifaceted approach. Short-term strategies like BTM power and retrofitting can bridge the gap, but long-term solutions demand investment in nuclear, renewables, and grid infrastructure. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) is exploring capacity market reforms, while PJM reports 45,000 MW of approved projects stalled by supply chain and permitting issues. Collaboration between data centers, utilities, and regulators is critical to balance AI-driven growth with grid reliability and affordability.

The data center industry is at a crossroads, fueling the digital economy but straining an outdated grid. As operators turn to on-site power and innovative technologies, the challenge is to meet AI’s demands without burdening consumers or compromising reliability.
