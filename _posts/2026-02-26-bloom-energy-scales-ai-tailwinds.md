Bloom Energy Corp. (NYSE:BE) closed 2025 with record-breaking results, fueled by what CEO KR Sridhar described as a “seismic” shift in how the world's largest industries secure electricity.  

The company reported record full-year revenue of $2.02 billion, a 37.3% increase over 2024, as AI data centers and manufacturing hubs moved toward energy independence.

### AI and the 800V DC Revolution

Bloom is positioning itself as the primary power layer for the AI boom.  

“AI is a huge tailwind for the power industry and a big catalyst for Bloom’s growth,” CEO Sridhar said on the company's earnings call, noting that AI computer racks consume nearly “100 times more power” than traditional predecessors.

In response to demand for AI data centers, Bloom launched a native 800-volt DC offering.  

Because digital equipment runs on DC, traditional AC-to-DC conversion in data centers creates waste and complexity.  

Sridhar argued that “800 volts DC will soon be the data center standard because physics requires it,” and boasted that “Bloom, and only Bloom, natively produces 800 volts DC today. No band-aids, or adapters needed.”

In a recent discussion with a Senior Eaton Power Electronics engineer, the concept of **localized fuel-cell clusters** providing native 800 Vdc directly to the server racks was raised as an intriguing evolution of this trend. Instead of centralizing high-voltage DC distribution across the entire facility, modular fuel-cell arrays could deliver 800 Vdc power right at the row or pod level—eliminating most AC-DC conversion losses, simplifying cabling, and enabling true “bring your own power” redundancy per compute zone. While still conceptual, this architecture could further reduce PUE and improve fault isolation in hyperscale AI campuses.

### ‘Bring Your Own Power’

The CEO highlighted the transition of fuel cells from a green alternative to a core infrastructure requirement on the call.  

“Bring your own power has become the mantra for data centers and power-hungry factories,” Sridhar stated, adding that “On-site power has moved from being a decision of last resort to a vital business necessity.”

The shift is evident in Bloom's staggering backlog growth. Product backlog surged 140% year over year to $6 billion, and total backlog reached approximately $20 billion.

### Bloom Energy 2026 Outlook

Bloom Energy CFO Maciej Kurzymski touted Bloom Energy's “incredible execution,” pointing to $271.6 million in adjusted EBITDA as proof of the “operating leverage there is in the business as we start to scale.”  

Looking ahead, Bloom issued an aggressive 2026 revenue guidance of $3.1 billion to $3.3 billion, well above analyst estimates.  

The company is betting on its ability to outpace traditional utilities as the AI build-out ramps up.  

“We will deliver our power platform faster than you can build your greenfield facilities,” Sridhar said.
