### Duke Energy's Carolinas Resource Plan: A Blueprint for Balanced Growth

The 2025 Carolinas Resource Plan serves as Duke's roadmap for North and South Carolina, responding to demand growth eight times faster than the previous 15 years, driven by 25,000 new jobs and $19 billion in investments. Key additions include 9.7 GW of natural gas-fired capacity by 2033, comprising five combined-cycle (CC) units for baseload and seven combustion turbines (CT) for peaking. Locations span Person County, NC (2 CCs), Anderson County, SC (1 CC), Catawba County, NC (2 CTs), Rowan County, NC (2 CTs), Richmond County, NC (1 CT), and undetermined sites (2 CCs and 2 CTs). This builds on existing complexes like the Person County Energy Complex and W.S. Lee Station. Solar additions total 7.9 GW by 2033, down from prior projections, while battery storage ramps to 7.9 GW (or 5,600 MW by 2034 in detailed modeling), enhancing grid flexibility. Offshore wind is deferred until 2040, deemed uneconomical. Nuclear uprates at four stations add nearly 300 MW, equivalent to a new SMR. Coal retirements at Belews Creek, Cliffside, and Marshall are delayed by 2-4 years for dual-fuel units, extending operations to 2033-2040 to bridge gaps. Enhanced LNG storage reduces fuel volatility. Kendal Bowman, Duke's North Carolina president, emphasized reliability and cost savings, projecting a 2.1% annual bill increase—lower than before. <a href="https://news.duke-energy.com/releases/duke-energy-files-2025-carolinas-resource-plan-continues-modernizing-energy-infrastructure-to-support-future-growth">[Duke Energy: 2025 Carolinas Resource Plan]</a> <a href="https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/articles/duke-energy-brings-large-scale-new-build-into-resource-plan">[World Nuclear News: Duke Large-Scale Nuclear]</a>

### Nuclear Advancements: SMRs and LLWRs on the Horizon

Duke is evaluating two sites for over 1.1 GW of new nuclear by 2037: Belews Creek in Stokes County, NC, for small modular reactors (SMRs), and the W.S. Lee site in Cherokee County, SC, for large light-water reactors (LLWRs). The Cherokee site holds a federal license for two Westinghouse AP1000 units, positioning it for potential large-scale builds. Belews Creek could host one of the first next-generation SMRs, leveraging existing infrastructure. These projects adapt to Trump administration incentives for nuclear, providing carbon-neutral baseload amid AI-driven demand. Pre-application activities with the NRC are underway for Belews Creek, with licensing expansions to preserve options. Nuclear complements gas and storage, offering 95%+ capacity factors ideal for data centers. <a href="https://www.nrc.gov/reactors/new-reactors/advanced/who-were-working-with/pre-application-activities/duke-energy-belews-creek">[NRC: Duke Belews Creek]</a> <a href="https://businessnc.com/duke-energy-favors-s-c-site-if-big-nuclear-plant-develops/">[Business NC: Duke SC Nuclear Site]</a>

### Solar and Battery Storage Expansions Across Territories

Duke's commitment to renewables includes 7.9 GW of solar in the Carolinas by 2033, with projects like expanded battery storage at the Mayo site. In Florida, the 2025 Ten-Year Site Plan outlines 12 new solar sites adding 900 MW between 2025-2027, including four new facilities contributing nearly 300 MW by 2026. Florida's plan manages 3,300 MW of renewables as of June 2025, with $521 million invested. In Indiana, the 2024 IRP proposes 2,218 MW of solar, alongside 450 MW of storage, to meet needs through 2044. Battery initiatives aim for over 6,000 MW system-wide by 2035, including pumped-storage extensions like Bad Creek in South Carolina (50-year license application). Western Carolinas sees new solar and storage in Buncombe County under the Modernization Project. These hybrid systems cut costs by 20-30% via demand response, supporting peaks from EV adoption and heatwaves. <a href="https://www.duke-energy.com/our-company/future/solar-and-renewables/energy-storage">[Duke Energy: Energy Storage]</a> <a href="https://dailyenergyinsider.com/news/47359-duke-energy-florida-plans-four-new-solar-energy-sites-in-sunshine-state/">[Daily Energy Insider: Florida Solar Sites]</a>

### Gas-Fired and LNG Projects: Localized Solutions for Reliability

Beyond Carolinas, Duke's gas expansions include hydrogen-capable units at Roxboro (Person County Energy Complex) and new plants in Rowan County repurposing the Buck Steam Station site. In Florida and Indiana, gas supports data center preparations, with Duke seeking approvals for rates and structures. Localized LNG-fueled stations are integral for high-demand areas, deployable in under a year to provide 10-50 MW for on-site power, reducing grid strain. For instance, data centers in North Carolina may require dedicated LNG microgeneration to avoid transmission bottlenecks, similar to national trends. In Kentucky, the 2024 IRP integrates gas with renewables for affordability. These systems, with 50% lower emissions than coal, ensure flexibility in regions like Anderson County, where the W.S. Lee expansion adds 750 MW CC and 180 MW boiler. <a href="https://illumination.duke-energy.com/articles/advancing-the-future-of-energy-with-person-county-nc">[Duke Illumination: Person County]</a> <a href="https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/business/article311350465.html">[Charlotte Observer: Rowan Gas Plants]</a>

### The Importance of Commissioning: Ensuring Safe and Timely Operations

Commissioning (Cx) is critical for Duke's projects, involving testing, verification, and startup to meet safety and efficiency standards. For gas plants in Person and Catawba counties, Cx includes turbine synchronization and emissions checks, targeting 2029 operations post-permits. Delays, as in past nuclear builds, can cost billions; Duke aims for streamlined processes in one-year LNG deployments and under-five-year nuclear. In Florida's solar sites, Cx ensures grid integration by 2026, preventing outages like the 2021 Texas event ($195 billion loss). Battery projects, like Gaston County's replacement of coal with Duke's largest battery by 2025 end, require phased Cx for performance guarantees. Efficient Cx saves costs and averts shortages amid 12.3 GW national retirements in 2025. <a href="https://www.energy-storage.news/us-utility-duke-energy-files-carolinas-resource-plan-including-5-6gwh-of-energy-storage/">[Energy Storage News: Duke Battery Target]</a> <a href="https://businessnc.com/end-of-an-era-duke-energy-replaces-gaston-coal-plant-with-batteries/">[Business NC: Gaston Battery]</a>
