# Fast-Tracking Velvet-Wood Mine: Powering AI Data Centers and U.S. Energy Security

**May 14, 2025**

The U.S. Department of the Interior’s expedited permitting of the Velvet-Wood mine in Utah, announced on May 11, 2025, marks a pivotal step in addressing the national energy emergency declared by President Donald J. Trump. By accelerating environmental reviews to 14 days under new emergency procedures, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) aims to unlock critical minerals vital for power systems and AI data centers. This move, part of a broader push for energy dominance, has significant implications for the U.S. energy grid, national security, and the booming AI sector. This article explores the Velvet-Wood project, its role in supporting AI data centers, and its broader impact on the U.S. energy landscape.

## The Velvet-Wood Mine and Critical Minerals

The Velvet-Wood mine, operated by Anfield Energy in San Juan County, Utah, is set to produce uranium and vanadium by reopening old Velvet Mine workings and developing the Velvet-Wood mineralization. Uranium powers nuclear reactors for clean energy, while vanadium supports steel alloys and battery technologies. The Department of the Interior’s emergency permitting, under the National Environmental Policy Act and related laws, compresses a multi-year process to just 14 days. This aligns with President Trump’s January 20, 2025, National Energy Emergency declaration, prioritizing domestic production to reduce foreign dependence—particularly from adversaries dominating global supplies. The BLM oversees responsible development, bolstering materials for grid infrastructure essential to high-power AI facilities.

## Implications for AI Data Centers

AI data centers are projected to consume up to 9% of U.S. electricity by 2030, with rack densities reaching 1–5 MW. Critical minerals like uranium enable reliable nuclear power for baseload energy, while vanadium aids advanced batteries and transformers for grid stability. Projects like Google’s 1 MW rack designs and Amazon’s nuclear investments depend on secure domestic supplies of these materials to scale without supply chain risks from China-dominated markets. Velvet-Wood’s output strengthens U.S. resilience, ensuring AI infrastructure expands amid surging demand.

## Strengthening the U.S. Energy Grid

AI-driven loads, alongside electrification, strain the grid with infrastructure bottlenecks. Velvet-Wood’s uranium supports nuclear expansion for stable power, and vanadium enhances energy storage and transmission components. The Department of Energy’s evaluations of sites for AI data center co-location highlight the urgency. Fast-tracking reduces typical 7–10 year U.S. mining delays (versus 2–5 years in Canada/Australia), enabling quicker integration of nuclear, renewables, and grid upgrades to meet AI needs.

## National Security and Economic Benefits

The National Energy Emergency declaration flags foreign mineral reliance as a threat to defense and economic stability. Velvet-Wood counters this by reviving domestic uranium production—vital for nuclear energy, medical uses, and military applications. It creates jobs, lowers manufacturer costs, and builds supply chain security. Reports suggest secure chains could save billions annually, with projects like this enhancing U.S. competitiveness and reducing vulnerabilities.

## Challenges and Sustainability Concerns

Expedited 14-day reviews spark debate over environmental, cultural, and community impacts, with critics noting limited public/tribal input. The BLM emphasizes stewardship and builds on prior data, but balancing speed and oversight remains key. Scaling requires refining capacity investments, as raw extraction alone falls short. Complementary innovations, like efficient transformers, could maximize benefits while minimizing waste.

## Industry-Wide Context and Trends

Velvet-Wood fits broader moves toward domestic independence, including Amazon’s small modular reactor investments and Microsoft’s nuclear restarts for AI power. The Interior’s FAST-41 program streamlines critical mineral projects, attracting investment and countering slower foreign permitting advantages. These align with Trump administration priorities to unleash energy potential.

## Looking Ahead

Velvet-Wood’s fast-tracked permitting precedents rapid domestic mineral development to fuel AI data centers and grid resilience. By 2030, increased production could cut foreign reliance, bolstering security and stability. Sustainability and stakeholder engagement will sustain support. As AI projects advance—like Google’s Arizona center—Velvet-Wood’s uranium and vanadium will underpin a robust, AI-ready energy future, positioning the U.S. for leadership in energy dominance.
