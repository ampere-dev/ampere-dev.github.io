---

The U.S. Department of the Interior’s expedited permitting of the Velvet-Wood uranium and vanadium mine in Utah, announced on May 12, 2025, signals a bold response to the national energy emergency declared by President Donald J. Trump. Coupled with discussions around thorium-based nuclear reactors and the potential revival of coal plants, this move aims to secure energy for AI data centers, strengthen the grid, and enhance national security. The Velvet-Wood project, as reported by ZeroHedge and the DOI, underscores America’s push for energy independence amid surging AI-driven power demands. This article explores the Velvet-Wood initiative, its implications for AI data centers, the role of thorium and coal, and the broader impact on the U.S. energy landscape. <a href="https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/interior-expedites-permitting-critical-energy-project-address-national-energy" target="_blank">Read the DOI press release</a>.

### Velvet-Wood Mine: Fueling Nuclear Power

The Velvet-Wood mine in San Juan County, Utah, is set to produce uranium and vanadium, critical for nuclear reactors and advanced alloys, respectively. The DOI’s emergency permitting, authorized under the National Environmental Policy Act, Endangered Species Act, and National Historic Preservation Act, reduces a typically years-long process to just 14 days. This aligns with President Trump’s January 20, 2025, National Energy Emergency declaration, which prioritizes domestic energy and mineral production to counter reliance on foreign adversaries. The mine, operated by Anfield Energy, will leverage existing Velvet Mine infrastructure, minimizing surface disturbance to three acres. If approved, it will feed the nearby Shootaring Canyon uranium mill, reducing import dependence and supporting AI data centers’ energy needs. <a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/commodities/us-fast-tracking-uranium-mine-permit-meet-urgent-energy-demands" target="_blank">Explore ZeroHedge’s coverage</a>.

### AI Data Centers and Uranium Demand

AI data centers, with rack densities projected to reach 1–5 MW by 2030, are driving unprecedented energy demand, potentially consuming 9% of U.S. electricity by 2030. Critical minerals from Velvet-Wood are vital for manufacturing high-efficiency transformers and energy storage systems to support these facilities. For instance, Google’s 1 MW rack designs and Amazon’s nuclear-powered data centers rely on advanced power components that use rare earths and lithium. By securing a domestic mineral supply, the U.S. can reduce supply chain vulnerabilities, ensuring AI infrastructure scales without reliance on geopolitical competitors like China, which dominates global mineral markets. <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/05/01/google_details_plans_for_1/" target="_blank">Explore Google’s 1 MW rack plans</a>.

### Thorium: A Potential Nuclear Alternative

While uranium dominates nuclear energy, thorium-based reactors are gaining attention as a safer, more sustainable alternative. A ZeroHedge report notes China’s 2025 unveiling of a meltdown-proof thorium reactor, leveraging U.S. research from the 1950s. Thorium offers higher fuel burn-up rates (55,000 MWd/T vs. uranium’s 7,000 MWd/T) and reduces plutonium waste by over 80%, making it ideal for AI data centers’ long-term needs. The U.S., through partnerships like Clean Core Thorium Energy with Texas A&M and Idaho National Laboratory, is developing thorium-based ANEEL fuel for existing reactors. Velvet-Wood’s uranium focus could complement thorium initiatives, diversifying nuclear options for energy-intensive AI applications. <a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/energy/china-unveils-worlds-1st-meltdown-proof-thorium-reactor" target="_blank">Read about thorium reactors</a>.

### Coal as an Interim Solution

To meet immediate energy demands, the Trump administration is exploring coal plant reopenings and new builds, as outlined in a ZeroHedge article. An April 2025 executive order aims to reverse coal leasing moratoriums, designating coal a “critical mineral” to boost its strategic role. Coal, supplying 15% of U.S. electricity in 2023, offers a reliable interim solution for AI data centers while nuclear capacity ramps up. The administration’s rollback of mercury and carbon regulations, combined with plans to reopen shuttered plants, could bridge the gap, though critics warn of environmental trade-offs. This strategy aligns with Interior Secretary Doug Burgum’s emphasis on “affordable and reliable” energy for data centers. <a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/energy/trump-set-sign-exec-order-boosting-domestic-coal-meet-ai-power-demands" target="_blank">Explore coal’s revival</a>.

### Impact on the U.S. Energy Grid

The U.S. energy grid faces strain from AI data centers and electrification, with the North American Electric Reliability Corporation warning of shortage risks by 2035. Velvet-Wood’s minerals will support the production of transformers and grid-scale batteries, enhancing grid reliability. The Department of Energy’s assessment of 16 DOE-managed sites for AI data center co-location, as noted in posts on X, underscores the need for robust power systems. Fast-tracking mineral extraction aligns with the Trump administration’s energy dominance agenda, reducing permitting delays that can stretch 7–10 years for mines, compared to 2–5 years in Australia and Canada. This ensures the grid can handle AI-driven loads while supporting renewable and nuclear integration. <a href="https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/trump-administration-adds-key-mining-projects-fast-41" target="_blank">Learn about FAST-41</a>.

### National Security and Economic Benefits

The Velvet-Wood project addresses national security risks from foreign mineral dependence, as highlighted in Trump’s energy emergency declaration. China and Russia dominate uranium and vanadium markets, posing threats to U.S. defense and AI industries. Domestic production from Velvet-Wood, potentially paired with thorium development, strengthens supply chains for nuclear reactors and aerospace alloys. Economically, the project will create jobs and reduce import costs, with the DOE estimating billions in savings from secure mineral chains. A Deloitte report estimates that secure mineral supply chains could save U.S. industries billions annually, with Velvet-Wood contributing to this economic resilience. <a href="https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/trump-administration-adds-key-mining-projects-fast-41" target="_blank">Learn about critical mineral strategies</a>.

### Challenges and Sustainability Concerns

Expedited permitting for Velvet-Wood and coal initiatives risks environmental oversight, with the Sierra Club warning that 14-day reviews may miss hazards, potentially polluting air and water. Thorium reactors, while promising, face regulatory and fuel supply hurdles, with the DOE’s disposal of uranium-233 stocks drawing criticism from advocates like the Thorium Energy Alliance. Coal’s revival, though interim, could delay renewable transitions, conflicting with net-zero goals of tech giants like Google. Innovations like 3D-printed transformers and immersion cooling could mitigate some impacts by improving efficiency. Public skepticism, fueled by Spain’s outage, underscores the need for transparent energy planning. <a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/energy/nuclear-energy-world-awaits-trump" target="_blank">Explore thorium challenges</a>.

### Looking Ahead

The Velvet-Wood mine, alongside thorium exploration and coal’s interim role, positions the U.S. to meet AI data center demands while advancing energy independence. By 2030, domestic mineral production could reduce reliance on foreign supplies, enhancing national security and economic stability. However, balancing speed with sustainability will be key to maintaining public trust. As projects like Google’s Arizona data center and the DOE’s site assessments advance, Velvet-Wood’s minerals will play a pivotal role in building a resilient, AI-ready energy infrastructure. The U.S. is poised to lead in AI and energy dominance, provided it navigates these challenges effectively. <a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/google-breaks-ground-on-first-arizona-data-center-in-mesa/" target="_blank">Discover Google’s Arizona project</a>.
