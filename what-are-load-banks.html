<h1 id="What_are_load_banks">What Are Load Banks?</h1>
<p class="ex2">A load bank is a specialized device that simulates an electrical load by converting electrical energy into a controlled load through resistance, inductance, or capacitance. It applies this load to a power source, transforming the energy into an electric or magnetic field and dissipating the resulting power output as heat.</p>
<p class="ex2">Load banks are constructed with load elements, protective features, incremental controls, metering, and accessories necessary for operation. They are primarily used to test power sources, such as standby generators and batteries, ensuring reliability under various conditions. Typically cooled by an electric motor and fan delivering the required cubic feet per minute (CFM) of airflow, load banks evaluate how critical systems respond to load changes.</p>
<p class="ex2">Unlike real-world loads, which are often dispersed, unpredictable, and variable, a load bank provides a precise, organized, and fully controllable load. This allows it to accurately replicate the operational demands a power source will encounter in actual applications.</p>
	
<h1 id="Why_conduct_load_banks_tests">Why Conduct Load Bank Tests?</h1>
<p class="ex2">Load bank testing ensures backup power systems, such as generators and UPS units, perform reliably during outages. Conducting tests in a controlled environment uncovers issues before they cause failures. Testing is essential during system commissioning and as part of ongoing maintenance.</p>
<p class="ex2"><strong>Key Benefits of Load Bank Testing:</strong></p>
<p class="ex2"><strong>1. Verifies System Reliability:</strong> Load bank testing is the only way to confirm a backup power system can handle full-power loads. Systems may function under light loads but fail under stress without regular testing.</p>
<p class="ex2"><strong>2. Prevents Wet Stacking in Generators:</strong> Prolonged operation under light loads can cause diesel generators to develop “wet stacking,” where unburned fuel or carbon builds up in the exhaust system. This reduces efficiency and risks permanent damage. Running the generator at sufficient load for a few hours corrects this issue.</p>
<p class="ex2"><strong>3. Ensures Standards Compliance:</strong> Standards like the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) <em>Standard for Emergency and Standby Power Systems</em>, ANSI/NETA <em>Standard for Maintenance Testing Specifications</em>, and Joint Commission requirements mandate load testing for commissioning and maintenance.</p>
<p class="ex2"><strong>4. Tests Integrated Systems:</strong> During data center commissioning, load banks simulate the heat load of critical electrical systems to test mechanical cooling systems. Water-cooled load banks verify chiller plants meet design specifications. Integrated system testing reveals issues that component-level or factory testing may miss.</p>
<p class="ex2"><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Regular load bank testing ensures backup power systems are ready for emergencies, minimizes downtime, and protects critical operations. It helps maintain compliance, optimize performance, and avoid costly failures.</p>
	
<h1 id="What_happens_during_a_load_bank_test">What Happens During a Load Bank Test?</h1>
<p class="ex2">Load bank testing validates the performance and battery autonomy of Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) systems and generators under load conditions. Conducted during preventative maintenance, it ensures reliable operation. For UPS systems, it also identifies weak battery cells in battery strings, enabling proactive replacement of cells nearing the end of their lifespan or failing to hold a charge.</p>
<p class="ex2">Suppliers of power protection equipment often provide load bank testing, sometimes during UPS commissioning. However, testing should occur at least one week after commissioning to allow battery voltages to stabilize and ensure full charging. Early testing may yield inaccurate results, wasting time and resources.</p>
<p class="ex2">A generator load bank test assesses and verifies that all primary components—engine, alternator, and controls—are functioning correctly. Specialized equipment applies artificial loads, bringing the generator to optimal operating temperature and pressure. This is critical for standby or emergency generators that rarely run or operate below 30% of their rated kilowatt (kW) capacity.</p>
<p class="ex2">A proper load bank test confirms that a generator can deliver its maximum rated power while maintaining stable temperature and pressure levels for extended periods. This ensures reliability during emergencies, especially for generators not regularly operating at full kW capacity, by simulating real-world demands.</p>
	
<h1 id="Benefits_of_load_bank_testing">Benefits of Load Bank Testing</h1>
<p class="ex2">Annual load bank testing is essential to ensure the reliability and performance of UPS systems and generators. Regular testing helps identify issues early and maintains optimal operation. Key benefits include:</p>
<p class="ex2">1. <strong>Verifies System Performance</strong>: Confirms that the UPS or generator can handle its full rated load, ensuring dependable operation during critical situations.</p>
<p class="ex2">2. <strong>Early Problem Detection</strong>: Identifies potential issues before they escalate, reducing repair costs and preventing major system failures.</p>
<p class="ex2">3. <strong>Ensures Cooling System Efficiency</strong>: Validates that cooling systems perform effectively under load, preventing overheating during extended operation.</p>
<p class="ex2">4. <strong>Supports Commissioning</strong>: Facilitates the commissioning of turbines and diesel generators, ensuring they meet operational standards before deployment.</p>
<p class="ex2">5. <strong>Reduces Wet Stacking</strong>: Mitigates wet stacking in diesel generators by allowing engines to reach optimal operating temperatures, improving efficiency and longevity.</p>
<p class="ex2">6. <strong>Optimizes Load Management</strong>: Enhances load distribution in prime power applications, ensuring balanced and efficient power delivery.</p>

	<h1 id="Load_bank_types">Load Bank Types</h1>
	<p class="ex2">The three most common types of load banks are resistive,
	inductive, and capacitive. Both inductive and capacitive loads create what is
	known as reactance in an AC circuit. Reactance is a circuit elements
	opposition to an alternating current, caused by the buildup of electric or
	magnetic fields in the element due to the current and is the "imaginary"
	component of impedance or the resistance to AC signals at a certain
	frequency.</p>
	
	<h1 id="Resistive">Resistive Load Banks</h1>
	<p class="ex2">A resistive load bank, the most common type, provides
	equivalent loading for both generators and prime movers. That is, for each
	kilowatt (or horsepower) of load applied to the generator by the load bank, an
	equal amount of load is applied to the prime mover by the generator. A
	resistive load bank, therefore, removes energy from the complete system: load
	bank from generator—generator from prime mover—prime mover from fuel.
	Additional energy is removed as a consequence of resistive load bank
	operation: waste heat from the coolant, exhaust and generator losses, and
	energy consumed by accessory devices. A resistive load bank impacts all
	aspects of a generating system.</p>
	<p class="ex2">Resistance is essentially friction against the flow of current.
	When the alternating current goes through a resistance, a voltage drop is
	produced that is in-phase with the current.</p>
	<p class="ex2">A load from a resistive load bank is created by the conversion
	of electrical energy to heat via high-power resistors such as wire-wound
	resistors. This heat must be dissipated from the load bank, either by air or
	by water, by forced means or convection.</p>
	<p class="ex2">Resistance is mathematically symbolized by the letter “R” and
	is measured in the unit of ohms (Ω).</p>
	<h1 id="Reactive">Reactive Load Banks</h1>
	<p class="ex2">Industrial electrical loads are comprised of both resistive and
	reactive type loads. Reactive, or reactance as it is commonly known, is a
	circuit elements opposition to an alternating current, caused by the build-up
	of electric or magnetic fields in the element due to the current. Both fields
	act to produce counter EMF that is proportional to either the rate of change
	(time derivative) or accumulation (time integral) of the current. In vector
	analysis, reactance is the imaginary part of electrical impedance, used to
	compute amplitude and phase changes of sinusoidal alternating current going
	through the circuit element.</p>
	<p class="ex2">Reactance is essentially inertia against the flow of current.
	It is present anywhere electric or magnetic fields are developed in proportion
	to an applied voltage or current, respectively; but most notably in capacitors
	and inductors.</p>
	<p class="ex2">Reactance, in itself, can mean either inductance (Positive
	Reactance) or capacitance (Negative Reactance).</p>
	
	<h1 id="Inductive">Inductive Load Banks</h1>
	<p class="ex2">An inductive load produces lagging power factor loads and
	consists of an iron-core or an air-core wound reactive element which, when
	used in conjunction with a resistive load bank, creating a lagging power
	factor load.</p>
	<p class="ex2">Typically, the inductive load will be rated at a numeric value
	75% that of the corresponding resistive load such that when applied together a
	resultant 0.8 power factor load is provided. That is to say, for each 100 kW
	of resistive load, 75 kVAr of inductance load is provided. Other ratios are
	possible to obtain other power factor ratings. An inductive load is used to
	simulate real-life mixed commercial loads consisting of lighting, heating,
	motors, and transformers.</p>
	<p class="ex2">When the alternating current goes through a pure reactance, a
	voltage drop is produced that is 90° out of phase with the current. Reactance
	is mathematically symbolized by the letter “X” and is measured in the unit of
	ohms (Ω).</p>
	<h1 id="Capacitive">Capacitive Load Banks</h1>
	<p class="ex2">A capacitive load produces leading power factor loads and
	consists of multiple metal plates separated by a dielectric or an air-core
	wound reactive element which, when used in conjunction with a resistive load
	bank, creating a leading power factor load.</p>
	<p class="ex2">These loads simulate certain electronic or non-linear loads
	typical of telecommunications, computer or UPS industries. Harmonic currents
	generated by nonlinear loads are becoming a pervasive problem, as "nonlinear"
	electrical load is a load on the electrical utility that requires current from
	the utility, whose electrical waveform is non-sinusoidal. Computers, fax
	machines, printers, electronic lighting ballasts, and variable-speed drives
	are prime examples of nonlinear loads that are capable of generating harmonic
	currents</p>
	
	<h1 id="Resistive/Reactive">Resistive/Reactive Load Banks</h1>
	<p class="ex2">Typically these are comprised of resistive and inductive load
	elements in one chassis. With a resistive-reactive load bank, full power
	system testing is possible, because the provided impedance supplies currents
	out of phase with voltage and allows for performance evaluation of generators,
	voltage regulators, load tap changers, conductors, switchgear and other
	equipment. Furthermore, the following functions can be performed.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Motor load simulation</li>
		<li>Q-factor resonance</li>
		<li>RLC network simulation</li>
		<li>UL1741 - IEEE 1547 Anti-islanding commissioning</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h1 id="Electronic">Electronic Load Banks</h1>
	<p class="ex2">An electronic load bank tends to be a fully programmable, air-
	or water-cooled design used to simulate a solid-state load and to provide
	constant power and current loading on circuits for precision testing.</p>
	<p class="ex2">Namely there are two types, AC and DC and commonly used to test
	power supplies, batteries and fuel cells.</p>
	<p class="ex2">Also, any active or passive current-carrying devices such as
	switches, circuit breakers, fuses, connectors and power semiconductors can be
	tested. Traditionally, many of these products are tested using resistive load
	banks. This approach does not simulate real-world conditions such as switching
	DC/AC converters found in many AC powered products. This type of conventional
	testing does not fully exercise the equipment under test (EUT) under
	worst-case operating conditions. High peak currents and low power factor loads
	can significantly impact the operating characteristics of a UPS or AC power
	product.</p>
	<p class="ex2">Typically five modes of operation:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Constant Current</li>
		<li>Constant Voltage</li>
		<li>Constant Power</li>
		<li>Constant Resistance</li>
		<li>Pulse frequency or Short circuit</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h1 id="Direct_Current">Direct Current Load Banks</h1>
	<p class="ex2">Direct current load banks are commonly used to test UPS and
	telecom battery strings. The acceptance load test is a capacity test performed
	to determine if the battery is capable of supplying the manufacturer’s rated
	discharge current for a given duration under a specific set of conditions. The
	battery is discharged at a constant current or power to a predefined end of
	discharge voltage. The actual discharge time is then compared to the
	manufacturer’s rated discharge time to determine actual capacity.</p>
	<h1 id="Medium_Voltage">Medium Voltage Load Banks</h1>
	<p class="ex2">A medium-voltage load bank is just like any other load bank
	commonly used, in that it contains resistors, reactors or capacitors. The
	voltage rating typically is 15kV being the maximum impressed potential allowed
	at the present time. This negates the need for transformers and allows for
	longer runs of cables and smaller conductors.</p>
	<p class="ex2">Medium-voltage load banks are often used for commissioning
	power plants, maritime electrical systems, standby generator systems, and
	substations, essentially the same as low – voltage load banks, the only
	difference being the voltage.</p>
	<p class="ex2">Generally, there are three kinds of medium-voltage load banks
	in use today:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Low-Voltage with transformer</li>
		<li>Container with transformer</li>
		<li>Direct connection</li>
	</ul>
	<p class="ex2">The use of an integrated transformer allows for finer
	load-resolution load-steps. The direct connection method, being much lighter
	and less labor-intensive, just requires medium-voltage cables from the
	source.</p>
	
	<h1 id="Server_Simulating">Server Simulating Load Banks</h1>
	<p class="ex2">Load banks built to mimic real-world scenarios, confirming
	airflow computational fluid dynamics modeling and maximizing power utilization
	effectiveness (PUE). Constructed from 19" wide rack-mountable chassis and are
	used to model true hot-aisle/cold-aisle containment systems, heat, and air
	flow in data centers.</p>
	<p class="ex2">These simulate physical servers as installed at a data – center
	by way of heat – discharge, electrical – resistance and airflow. The resultant
	heat output of the load banks are of a benefit in that they are used to load
	computer room air – conditioners, whilst creating an electrical load to the
	primary and standby systems in the data center.</p>
	<p class="ex2">Variable controls provide for granular airflow, Delta-T and
	deferential pressure compensation at various altitudes. This allows the
	operator to fine-tune the load bank, as to mimic the server it is modeling and
	match the environmental conditions.</p>
	<p class="ex2">Data-centers are built to maintain a 2N (A/B) utility grid
	redundancy and the majority of server simulating loads are designed to
	facilitate that network design. Either channel A or B can be intentionally
	disabled via a master load switch and in doing so, the fans and electrical
	load on that channel can be shut off to inhibit load application for that
	channel.</p>
	
	<h1 id="Non-Linear">Non-Linear Load Banks</h1>
	<p class="ex2">A load is considered non-linear if its impedance changes with
	the applied voltage. The changing impedance means that the current drawn by
	the non-linear load will not be sinusoidal even when it is connected to a
	sinusoidal voltage. These nonsinusoidal currents contain harmonic currents
	that interact with the impedance of the power distribution system to create
	voltage distortion that can affect both the distribution system equipment and
	the loads connected to it.</p>
	<p class="ex2">In the past, non-linear loads were primarily found in heavy
	industrial applications such as arc furnaces, large variable frequency drives
	(VFD), heavy rectifiers for electrolytic refining, etc. The harmonics they
	generated were typically localized and often addressed by experts.</p>
	<p class="ex2">Times have changed and harmonic problems are now common in not
	only industrial applications but in commercial buildings as well. This is due
	primarily to new power conversion technologies, such as the Switchmode Power
	Supply (SMPS), which can be found in virtually every power electronics and
	power conversion device. Namely wind – farms are notorious for this and
	require special considerations due to the extra harmonic content.</p>
	
	<h1 id="400Hz">400Hz Load Banks</h1>
	<p class="ex2">Power frequencies as high as 400 Hz are used in aircraft,
	spacecraft, submarines and military equipment. 400 Hz systems are used where
	weight is important because the magnetic cores can be smaller/lighter. This
	applies to transformers as well since a lower inductance (smaller core/number
	of turns) can be used than required by lower frequencies.</p>
	<p class="ex2">Induction motors turn at a speed proportional to frequency, so
	a high-frequency power supply allows more power to be obtained for the same
	motor volume and mass. Transformers and motors for 400 Hz are much smaller and
	lighter than at 50 or 60 Hz, which is an advantage in aircraft and ships.</p>
	<p class="ex2">Resistive load banks rated for 60Hz can function at 400Hz
	without a problem, only the reactive loads must be built specifically for the
	frequency.</p>
	
	<h1 id="Regenerative">Regenerative Load Banks</h1>
	<p class="ex2">Regenerative braking is the process of opposing inertial load
	by converting kinetic energy to electricity than heat using resistors, which
	is essential for generator-powered moving machinery that carries and moves
	vast weights such as elevators, cranes, and hoists.</p>
	<p class="ex2">All-electric cars built today, use regen to capture a large
	portion of the load during braking, and stores it back into the battery. Regen
	usually loses around 10-20% of the energy being captured, and then the car
	loses another 10-20% or so when converting that energy back into
	acceleration.</p>
	<p class="ex2">These are seen primarily used to capture and dissipate
	regenerative power from large motors and are found in the following
	settings:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Cranes and rigs</li>
		<li>Mining</li>
		<li>Cable laying vessels</li>
		<li>Elevators</li>
	</ul>
	
<h1 id="Water_Cooled">Water-Cooled Load Banks</h1>
<p class="ex2">Water-cooled load banks are specialized testing units that use a liquid cooling system, typically chilled water, to dissipate heat generated during power system testing.

<h1 id="Radiator_Mounted">Radiator Mounted Load Banks</h1>
<p><img alt="Radiator Load Bank" class="ex2" src="/images/Radiator%20load%20bank.webp" style="width:640px;height:480px;margin-left:15px;"></p>
<p class="ex2">A radiator-mounted load bank is designed to attach directly in front of a diesel generator’s radiator, utilizing the generator’s engine fan to provide cooling airflow for the resistive elements. These load banks deliver supplemental loads, typically 50–70% of the generator’s nameplate kW rating, to mitigate issues caused by light loading, such as wet stacking.</p>
<p class="ex2"><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Provides supplemental load to ensure proper generator operation under controlled conditions.</li>
    <li><strong>Cooling:</strong> Relies on the generator’s radiator fan, requiring a minimum of 1,000 linear feet per minute of continuous cooling airflow to prevent overheating.</li>
    <li><strong>Applications:</strong> Ideal for single-generator setups needing periodic supplemental loading.</li>
</ul>
<p class="ex2"><strong>Limitations and Considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Capacity Constraints:</strong> Load banks exceeding 1,200 kW may be impractical, as the size and number of load elements could exceed the radiator’s face area, restricting cooling airflow.</li>
    <li><strong>Resistive-Only Design:</strong> Radiator-mounted load banks are typically not suited for applications requiring both resistive and reactive loads. Separate freestanding resistive and reactive load banks, connected in parallel, are recommended.</li>
    <li><strong>Multi-Generator Systems:</strong> For multiple generators operating in parallel, a single large load bank connected to the emergency bus via a dedicated circuit breaker is often more effective, shared across all generators.</li>
    <li><strong>Airflow Requirements:</strong> Resistor elements must receive unobstructed radiator cooling airflow. Insufficient airflow can overheat resistors and the terminal compartment, damaging the load bank, generator, or other components, posing safety risks, and voiding warranties.</li>
    <li><strong>Enclosure Isolation:</strong> The customer terminal connection and contactor side enclosure must be isolated from the radiator’s hot airflow to prevent overheating electrical components. The enclosure must avoid obstructing radiator airflow, which could add external static pressure and overheat the engine or cooling system.</li>
    <li><strong>Static Pressure Limits:</strong> Radiator-mounted load banks typically add 0.125–0.50 inches of external static pressure (0.25 inches on average) to the cooling system. Exceeding the engine’s static pressure capacity can compromise performance and damage the system.</li>
    <li><strong>Supplemental Use Only:</strong> These load banks are designed for intermittent supplemental loading (up to 50% of generator kW rating), not continuous operation or 100% loading. Continuous or full-load operation can cause heat rejection back to the radiator, raising ambient temperatures and risking system damage.</li>
</ul>
<p class="ex2"><strong>Recommendations for Continuous or Full-Load Operation:</strong></p>
<p class="ex2">For applications requiring continuous operation or 100% load, consider a stationary outdoor load bank with its own integral cooling fan. These units operate in a free-field environment with fresh ambient air, independent of the generator’s heated radiator airflow.</p>
