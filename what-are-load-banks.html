<h1 id="What_are_load_banks">What Are Load Banks?</h1>
<p class="ex2">A load bank is a specialized device that simulates an electrical load by converting electrical energy into a controlled load through resistance, inductance, or capacitance. It applies this load to a power source, transforming the energy into an electric or magnetic field and dissipating the resulting power output as heat.</p>
<p class="ex2">Load banks are constructed with load elements, protective features, incremental controls, metering, and accessories necessary for operation. They are primarily used to test power sources, such as standby generators and batteries, ensuring reliability under various conditions. Typically cooled by an electric motor and fan delivering the required cubic feet per minute (CFM) of airflow, load banks evaluate how critical systems respond to load changes.</p>
<p class="ex2">Unlike real-world loads, which are often dispersed, unpredictable, and variable, a load bank provides a precise, organized, and fully controllable load. This allows it to accurately replicate the operational demands a power source will encounter in actual applications.</p>
	
<h1 id="Why_conduct_load_banks_tests">Why Conduct Load Bank Tests?</h1>
<p class="ex2">Load bank testing ensures backup power systems, such as generators and UPS units, perform reliably during outages. Conducting tests in a controlled environment uncovers issues before they cause failures. Testing is essential during system commissioning and as part of ongoing maintenance.</p>
<p class="ex2"><strong>Key Benefits of Load Bank Testing:</strong></p>
<p class="ex2"><strong>1. Verifies System Reliability:</strong> Load bank testing is the only way to confirm a backup power system can handle full-power loads. Systems may function under light loads but fail under stress without regular testing.</p>
<p class="ex2"><strong>2. Prevents Wet Stacking in Generators:</strong> Prolonged operation under light loads can cause diesel generators to develop “wet stacking,” where unburned fuel or carbon builds up in the exhaust system. This reduces efficiency and risks permanent damage. Running the generator at sufficient load for a few hours corrects this issue.</p>
<p class="ex2"><strong>3. Ensures Standards Compliance:</strong> Standards like the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) <em>Standard for Emergency and Standby Power Systems</em>, ANSI/NETA <em>Standard for Maintenance Testing Specifications</em>, and Joint Commission requirements mandate load testing for commissioning and maintenance.</p>
<p class="ex2"><strong>4. Tests Integrated Systems:</strong> During data center commissioning, load banks simulate the heat load of critical electrical systems to test mechanical cooling systems. Water-cooled load banks verify chiller plants meet design specifications. Integrated system testing reveals issues that component-level or factory testing may miss.</p>
<p class="ex2"><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Regular load bank testing ensures backup power systems are ready for emergencies, minimizes downtime, and protects critical operations. It helps maintain compliance, optimize performance, and avoid costly failures.</p>
	
<h1 id="What_happens_during_a_load_bank_test">What Happens During a Load Bank Test?</h1>
<p class="ex2">Load bank testing validates the performance and battery autonomy of Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) systems and generators under load conditions. Conducted during preventative maintenance, it ensures reliable operation. For UPS systems, it also identifies weak battery cells in battery strings, enabling proactive replacement of cells nearing the end of their lifespan or failing to hold a charge.</p>
<p class="ex2">Suppliers of power protection equipment often provide load bank testing, sometimes during UPS commissioning. However, testing should occur at least one week after commissioning to allow battery voltages to stabilize and ensure full charging. Early testing may yield inaccurate results, wasting time and resources.</p>
<p class="ex2">A generator load bank test assesses and verifies that all primary components—engine, alternator, and controls—are functioning correctly. Specialized equipment applies artificial loads, bringing the generator to optimal operating temperature and pressure. This is critical for standby or emergency generators that rarely run or operate below 30% of their rated kilowatt (kW) capacity.</p>
<p class="ex2">A proper load bank test confirms that a generator can deliver its maximum rated power while maintaining stable temperature and pressure levels for extended periods. This ensures reliability during emergencies, especially for generators not regularly operating at full kW capacity, by simulating real-world demands.</p>
	
<h1 id="Benefits_of_load_bank_testing">Benefits of Load Bank Testing</h1>
<p class="ex2">Annual load bank testing is essential to ensure the reliability and performance of UPS systems and generators. Regular testing helps identify issues early and maintains optimal operation. Key benefits include:</p>
<p class="ex2">1. <strong>Verifies System Performance</strong>: Confirms that the UPS or generator can handle its full rated load, ensuring dependable operation during critical situations.</p>
<p class="ex2">2. <strong>Early Problem Detection</strong>: Identifies potential issues before they escalate, reducing repair costs and preventing major system failures.</p>
<p class="ex2">3. <strong>Ensures Cooling System Efficiency</strong>: Validates that cooling systems perform effectively under load, preventing overheating during extended operation.</p>
<p class="ex2">4. <strong>Supports Commissioning</strong>: Facilitates the commissioning of turbines and diesel generators, ensuring they meet operational standards before deployment.</p>
<p class="ex2">5. <strong>Reduces Wet Stacking</strong>: Mitigates wet stacking in diesel generators by allowing engines to reach optimal operating temperatures, improving efficiency and longevity.</p>
<p class="ex2">6. <strong>Optimizes Load Management</strong>: Enhances load distribution in prime power applications, ensuring balanced and efficient power delivery.</p>

	<h1 id="Load_bank_types">Load Bank Types</h1>
	<p class="ex2">The three most common types of load banks are resistive,
	inductive, and capacitive. Both inductive and capacitive loads create what is
	known as reactance in an AC circuit. Reactance is a circuit elements
	opposition to an alternating current, caused by the buildup of electric or
	magnetic fields in the element due to the current and is the "imaginary"
	component of impedance or the resistance to AC signals at a certain
	frequency.</p>
	
	<h1 id="Resistive">Resistive Load Banks</h1>
	<p class="ex2">A resistive load bank, the most common type, provides
	equivalent loading for both generators and prime movers. That is, for each
	kilowatt (or horsepower) of load applied to the generator by the load bank, an
	equal amount of load is applied to the prime mover by the generator. A
	resistive load bank, therefore, removes energy from the complete system: load
	bank from generator—generator from prime mover—prime mover from fuel.
	Additional energy is removed as a consequence of resistive load bank
	operation: waste heat from the coolant, exhaust and generator losses, and
	energy consumed by accessory devices. A resistive load bank impacts all
	aspects of a generating system.</p>
	<p class="ex2">Resistance is essentially friction against the flow of current.
	When the alternating current goes through a resistance, a voltage drop is
	produced that is in-phase with the current.</p>
	<p class="ex2">A load from a resistive load bank is created by the conversion
	of electrical energy to heat via high-power resistors such as wire-wound
	resistors. This heat must be dissipated from the load bank, either by air or
	by water, by forced means or convection.</p>
	<p class="ex2">Resistance is mathematically symbolized by the letter “R” and
	is measured in the unit of ohms (Ω).</p>
	<h1 id="Reactive">Reactive Load Banks</h1>
	<p class="ex2">Industrial electrical loads are comprised of both resistive and
	reactive type loads. Reactive, or reactance as it is commonly known, is a
	circuit elements opposition to an alternating current, caused by the build-up
	of electric or magnetic fields in the element due to the current. Both fields
	act to produce counter EMF that is proportional to either the rate of change
	(time derivative) or accumulation (time integral) of the current. In vector
	analysis, reactance is the imaginary part of electrical impedance, used to
	compute amplitude and phase changes of sinusoidal alternating current going
	through the circuit element.</p>
	<p class="ex2">Reactance is essentially inertia against the flow of current.
	It is present anywhere electric or magnetic fields are developed in proportion
	to an applied voltage or current, respectively; but most notably in capacitors
	and inductors.</p>
	<p class="ex2">Reactance, in itself, can mean either inductance (Positive
	Reactance) or capacitance (Negative Reactance).</p>
	
	<h1 id="Inductive">Inductive Load Banks</h1>
	<p class="ex2">An inductive load produces lagging power factor loads and
	consists of an iron-core or an air-core wound reactive element which, when
	used in conjunction with a resistive load bank, creating a lagging power
	factor load.</p>
	<p class="ex2">Typically, the inductive load will be rated at a numeric value
	75% that of the corresponding resistive load such that when applied together a
	resultant 0.8 power factor load is provided. That is to say, for each 100 kW
	of resistive load, 75 kVAr of inductance load is provided. Other ratios are
	possible to obtain other power factor ratings. An inductive load is used to
	simulate real-life mixed commercial loads consisting of lighting, heating,
	motors, and transformers.</p>
	<p class="ex2">When the alternating current goes through a pure reactance, a
	voltage drop is produced that is 90° out of phase with the current. Reactance
	is mathematically symbolized by the letter “X” and is measured in the unit of
	ohms (Ω).</p>
	<h1 id="Capacitive">Capacitive Load Banks</h1>
	<p class="ex2">A capacitive load produces leading power factor loads and
	consists of multiple metal plates separated by a dielectric or an air-core
	wound reactive element which, when used in conjunction with a resistive load
	bank, creating a leading power factor load.</p>
	<p class="ex2">These loads simulate certain electronic or non-linear loads
	typical of telecommunications, computer or UPS industries. Harmonic currents
	generated by nonlinear loads are becoming a pervasive problem, as "nonlinear"
	electrical load is a load on the electrical utility that requires current from
	the utility, whose electrical waveform is non-sinusoidal. Computers, fax
	machines, printers, electronic lighting ballasts, and variable-speed drives
	are prime examples of nonlinear loads that are capable of generating harmonic
	currents</p>
	
	<h1 id="Resistive/Reactive">Resistive/Reactive Load Banks</h1>
	<p class="ex2">Typically these are comprised of resistive and inductive load
	elements in one chassis. With a resistive-reactive load bank, full power
	system testing is possible, because the provided impedance supplies currents
	out of phase with voltage and allows for performance evaluation of generators,
	voltage regulators, load tap changers, conductors, switchgear and other
	equipment. Furthermore, the following functions can be performed.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Motor load simulation</li>
		<li>Q-factor resonance</li>
		<li>RLC network simulation</li>
		<li>UL1741 - IEEE 1547 Anti-islanding commissioning</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h1 id="Electronic">Electronic Load Banks</h1>
	<p class="ex2">An electronic load bank tends to be a fully programmable, air-
	or water-cooled design used to simulate a solid-state load and to provide
	constant power and current loading on circuits for precision testing.</p>
	<p class="ex2">Namely there are two types, AC and DC and commonly used to test
	power supplies, batteries and fuel cells.</p>
	<p class="ex2">Also, any active or passive current-carrying devices such as
	switches, circuit breakers, fuses, connectors and power semiconductors can be
	tested. Traditionally, many of these products are tested using resistive load
	banks. This approach does not simulate real-world conditions such as switching
	DC/AC converters found in many AC powered products. This type of conventional
	testing does not fully exercise the equipment under test (EUT) under
	worst-case operating conditions. High peak currents and low power factor loads
	can significantly impact the operating characteristics of a UPS or AC power
	product.</p>
	<p class="ex2">Typically five modes of operation:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Constant Current</li>
		<li>Constant Voltage</li>
		<li>Constant Power</li>
		<li>Constant Resistance</li>
		<li>Pulse frequency or Short circuit</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h1 id="Direct_Current">Direct Current Load Banks</h1>
	<p class="ex2">Direct current load banks are commonly used to test UPS and
	telecom battery strings. The acceptance load test is a capacity test performed
	to determine if the battery is capable of supplying the manufacturer’s rated
	discharge current for a given duration under a specific set of conditions. The
	battery is discharged at a constant current or power to a predefined end of
	discharge voltage. The actual discharge time is then compared to the
	manufacturer’s rated discharge time to determine actual capacity.</p>
	<h1 id="Medium_Voltage">Medium Voltage Load Banks</h1>
	<p class="ex2">A medium-voltage load bank is just like any other load bank
	commonly used, in that it contains resistors, reactors or capacitors. The
	voltage rating typically is 15kV being the maximum impressed potential allowed
	at the present time. This negates the need for transformers and allows for
	longer runs of cables and smaller conductors.</p>
	<p class="ex2">Medium-voltage load banks are often used for commissioning
	power plants, maritime electrical systems, standby generator systems, and
	substations, essentially the same as low – voltage load banks, the only
	difference being the voltage.</p>
	<p class="ex2">Generally, there are three kinds of medium-voltage load banks
	in use today:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Low-Voltage with transformer</li>
		<li>Container with transformer</li>
		<li>Direct connection</li>
	</ul>
	<p class="ex2">The use of an integrated transformer allows for finer
	load-resolution load-steps. The direct connection method, being much lighter
	and less labor-intensive, just requires medium-voltage cables from the
	source.</p>
	
	<h1 id="Server_Simulating">Server Simulating Load Banks</h1>
	<p class="ex2">Load banks built to mimic real-world scenarios, confirming
	airflow computational fluid dynamics modeling and maximizing power utilization
	effectiveness (PUE). Constructed from 19" wide rack-mountable chassis and are
	used to model true hot-aisle/cold-aisle containment systems, heat, and air
	flow in data centers.</p>
	<p class="ex2">These simulate physical servers as installed at a data – center
	by way of heat – discharge, electrical – resistance and airflow. The resultant
	heat output of the load banks are of a benefit in that they are used to load
	computer room air – conditioners, whilst creating an electrical load to the
	primary and standby systems in the data center.</p>
	<p class="ex2">Variable controls provide for granular airflow, Delta-T and
	deferential pressure compensation at various altitudes. This allows the
	operator to fine-tune the load bank, as to mimic the server it is modeling and
	match the environmental conditions.</p>
	<p class="ex2">Data-centers are built to maintain a 2N (A/B) utility grid
	redundancy and the majority of server simulating loads are designed to
	facilitate that network design. Either channel A or B can be intentionally
	disabled via a master load switch and in doing so, the fans and electrical
	load on that channel can be shut off to inhibit load application for that
	channel.</p>
	
	<h1 id="Non-Linear">Non-Linear Load Banks</h1>
	<p class="ex2">A load is considered non-linear if its impedance changes with
	the applied voltage. The changing impedance means that the current drawn by
	the non-linear load will not be sinusoidal even when it is connected to a
	sinusoidal voltage. These nonsinusoidal currents contain harmonic currents
	that interact with the impedance of the power distribution system to create
	voltage distortion that can affect both the distribution system equipment and
	the loads connected to it.</p>
	<p class="ex2">In the past, non-linear loads were primarily found in heavy
	industrial applications such as arc furnaces, large variable frequency drives
	(VFD), heavy rectifiers for electrolytic refining, etc. The harmonics they
	generated were typically localized and often addressed by experts.</p>
	<p class="ex2">Times have changed and harmonic problems are now common in not
	only industrial applications but in commercial buildings as well. This is due
	primarily to new power conversion technologies, such as the Switchmode Power
	Supply (SMPS), which can be found in virtually every power electronics and
	power conversion device. Namely wind – farms are notorious for this and
	require special considerations due to the extra harmonic content.</p>
	
	<h1 id="400Hz">400Hz Load Banks</h1>
	<p class="ex2">Power frequencies as high as 400 Hz are used in aircraft,
	spacecraft, submarines and military equipment. 400 Hz systems are used where
	weight is important because the magnetic cores can be smaller/lighter. This
	applies to transformers as well since a lower inductance (smaller core/number
	of turns) can be used than required by lower frequencies.</p>
	<p class="ex2">Induction motors turn at a speed proportional to frequency, so
	a high-frequency power supply allows more power to be obtained for the same
	motor volume and mass. Transformers and motors for 400 Hz are much smaller and
	lighter than at 50 or 60 Hz, which is an advantage in aircraft and ships.</p>
	<p class="ex2">Resistive load banks rated for 60Hz can function at 400Hz
	without a problem, only the reactive loads must be built specifically for the
	frequency.</p>
	
	<h1 id="Regenerative">Regenerative Load Banks</h1>
	<p class="ex2">Regenerative braking is the process of opposing inertial load
	by converting kinetic energy to electricity than heat using resistors, which
	is essential for generator-powered moving machinery that carries and moves
	vast weights such as elevators, cranes, and hoists.</p>
	<p class="ex2">All-electric cars built today, use regen to capture a large
	portion of the load during braking, and stores it back into the battery. Regen
	usually loses around 10-20% of the energy being captured, and then the car
	loses another 10-20% or so when converting that energy back into
	acceleration.</p>
	<p class="ex2">These are seen primarily used to capture and dissipate
	regenerative power from large motors and are found in the following
	settings:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Cranes and rigs</li>
		<li>Mining</li>
		<li>Cable laying vessels</li>
		<li>Elevators</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h1 id="Water_Cooled">Water Cooled Load Banks</h1>
	<p class="ex2">Often, situations require customers to test power supplies,
	namely generators and UPS systems, in locations that are not conducive to
	normal forced-air cooled load banks, either due to environment or physical
	constraints.</p>
	<p class="ex2">In these situations, very long runs of cables may be used, but
	voltage-drop due to Ohms law may pose and add to the existing challenge. So
	this leaves us with an open-loop, water-cycle load cell, whereby chilled water
	is supplied to a device with heating elements, think of it as an expensive
	hot-water heater.</p>
	<p class="ex2">These can also be used to test data center chillers, a UPS
	system that is underground, located in a parking garage or located on top of a
	rooftop and may be used to provide heated water to simulate water-based server
	and or chillers.</p>
	
	<h1 id="Container">Container Load Banks</h1>
	<p class="ex2">These are typically built into existing ISO containers of
	various sizes and are used extensively in severe weather environments,
	off-shore platforms and international shipping. Crestchic and ASCO are two
	suppliers that exclusively deal with this model load bank.</p>
	<h1 id="Trailer_Mounted">Trailer Mounted Load Banks</h1>
	<p class="ex2">This is a load bank bolted to a trailer and towed to various
	job sites. Far easier than having to constantly load and off-load a trailer
	with a forklift.</p>
	<p class="ex2">If the trailer is low enough, these can be used to test
	underground generation using oversized loads, without having to run very long
	runs of cables to the outside.</p>
	
	<h1 id="Radiator_Mounted">Radiator Mounted Load Banks</h1>
	<p><img alt="Radiator Load Bank" class="ex2" src=
	"/images/Radiator%20load%20bank.webp" style=
	"width:640px;height:480px;margin-left:15px;"></p>
	<p class="ex2">A radiator mounted load bank is specifically designed to mount
	in front of the radiator on a diesel generating set. The engine fans of the
	generator provide suitable airflow to cool the resistive elements. Radiator
	mounted load banks are intended to supply supplemental load between 50-70% of
	the nameplate kW rating of the gen-set to alleviate the effects associated
	with light loading.</p>
	<p class="ex2">Limitations:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Radiator-mounted load bank ratings in excess of 1200kW may not be
		practical as the number and size of load elements may cause the load bank
		assembly to exceed the typical radiator’s face area (remember that the load
		bank elements must be exposed to the cooling airflow).</li>
		<li>Applications requiring a resistive and reactive load bank may not be
		well-suited for radiator-mounted load banks, due to the separate compartments
		required for the different elements. A pair of freestanding load banks (one
		resistive, one reactive), connected in parallel, may offer a better solution
		under these conditions.</li>
		<li>Applications consisting of multiple generators in parallel, it may be
		best to utilize a single, large load bank. A single load bank is generally
		connected to the emergency bus via a dedicated circuit breaker and shared by
		all generators.</li>
		<li>Note: the resistor load elements require a continuous free flow of all
		the radiator cooling airflow and must be directly coupled to capture all of
		the radiator cooling airflow. The load resistors require a minimum of 1000
		linear feet per minute of continuous cooling airflow. The amount of adequate
		required cooling airflow must be verified prior to installation. Airflow of
		less than sufficent quantity, will result in over-heating of the load
		resistors and terminal compartment causing damage to load bank resistor
		elements and terminal compartment components, damage to the generator set,
		harm to personnel, and would void any warranty.</li>
		<li>The customer terminal connection and contactor side enclosure must be
		isolated from the coupling of the radiator cooling airflow to the resistors,
		and cannot obstruct radiator engine cooling airflow. The excessive heat from
		the radiator fan air will over-heat the side enclosure and cause damage to
		electrical components within the enclosure. In addition, the side enclosure
		cannot obstruct the radiator cooling airflow as it will add external static
		pressure as an obstruction to radiator engine cooling air and overheat the
		engine and cooling system.</li>
		<li>Careful consideration must be given as to the amount of external static
		pressure drop the engine radiator cooling system can handle and must never be
		exceeded. The load bank will typically add between 0.125 to 0.50 inches of
		external static pressure drop to the cooling system (0.25 inches on average).
		For this reason, a radiator duct mounted load bank should only be used as a
		supplemental load to the generator set (as needed) and not exceed 50 percent
		of generator KW rating.</li>
		<li>Radiator duct mounted load banks are intended to provide a supplemental
		load to the generator set (as needed) and not intended for continuous
		operation and 100 percent loading while coupled to the engine radiator as the
		resistor load elements cause heat rejection back to the radiator cooling
		system of the engine. They are also operated in a higher than normal raised
		ambient environment. If continuous operation, or operation at 100 percent
		load is required, it is recommended that a stationary outdoor load bank with
		its own integral cooling fan be considered which can be installed in a free
		field with a continuous flow of fresh ambient cooling air and not rely on the
		heated airflow from the engine radiator.</li>

	<h1 id="Portable">Portable Load Banks</h1>
	<p><img alt="Portable Load Bank" class="ex2" src=
	"/images/Portable%20Load%20Bank.webp" style=
	"width:480px;height:600px;margin-left:15px;"></p>
	<p class="ex2">Portable load banks are used in a wide variety of service and
	rental applications for the temporary testing of power systems. Portable load
	banks can be as small as 5-10 kW or as large as 700 kW. A properly designed
	portable load bank should have overall dimensions small enough to fit through
	a man door or freight elevator.</p>
	<p class="ex2">Portable load banks are built to transport safely to job sites,
	including remote locations. Once onsite, portable load banks are designed to
	be easily moved from one testing location to another.</p>
	<p class="ex2">One of the more useful load banks for equipment testing and
	commissioning, portable load banks are great for rooftop generator testing.
	When using a crane to lift a large load bank onto a building top becomes cost
	prohibitive, and landing long runs of power cable is counterintuitive due to
	voltage-drop. It becomes the winning option to move multiple small loads
	instead.</p>
	<h1 id="Resonant">Resonant Load Banks</h1>
	<p class="ex2">These are a special class of load banks combining an exact
	balance of resistive, inductive and capacitive loads into one package, in a
	1:1:1, or 1:2.5:2.5 ratios to provide a specific quality – factor. They
	function by building a resonant electrical network in either a series or
	parallel arrangement for quality factor testing of inverters.</p>
	<p class="ex2">Resonant loads are becoming increasingly prevalent due to solar
	inverter anti-islanding testing and commissioning per UL1741 and IEEE 1547 on
	photovoltaic systems.</p>
	<p class="ex2">The Q, quality factor, of a resonant circuit, is a measure of
	the “goodness” or quality of a resonant circuit. A higher value for this
	figure of merit corresponds to a more narrow bandwidth, which is desirable in
	many applications. More formally, Q is the ratio of power stored to the power
	dissipated in the circuit reactance and resistance.</p>
	<p class="ex2">Many solar inverters are designed to be connected to a utility
	grid, and will not operate when they do not detect the presence of the grid.
	They contain special circuitry to precisely match the voltage and frequency of
	the grid.</p>
	<p class="ex2">Traditional utility electric power systems were designed to
	support a one-way power flow from the point of generation through a
	transmission system to distribution level loads. These systems were not
	originally intended to accommodate the back – feed of power from distributed
	generation systems at the distribution level.</p>
	<p class="ex2">Islanding refers to the condition in which a distributed
	generator continues to power a location even though electrical grid power when
	the electric utility is no longer present. Islanding can be dangerous to
	utility workers, who may not realize that a circuit is still powered, and it
	may prevent the automatic reconnection of devices. For that reason,
	distributed generators must detect islanding and immediately stop producing
	power; this is referred to as anti-islanding.</p>
	<h1 id="Wye_Configured">Wye Configured Load Banks</h1>
	<p class="ex2">As the majority of load banks are built in a delta
	configuration, wye configured loads have an added neutral connection. If
	properly configured, this can be used to test a source with an unbalanced
	load.</p>
	<center><img src="/images/wye.webp"></center>
	<h1 id="Lab_Testing">Lab Testing Load Banks</h1>
	<p class="ex2">Built with very fine load resolution load-steps and can be
	comprised of all three linear elements mention previously. Typically used in
	research and development and university settings for product design.</p>
	<h1 id="Microgrid">Microgrid Load Banks</h1>
	<p class="ex2">Recent years have seen expanded interest in the development and
	deployment of microgrids. A microgrid distribution model uses a local source
	or group of sources to supply electrical power to facilities and communities.
	Microgrids may use both renewable and fuel-based energy sources and are
	increasingly used as sources of primary and supplemental power. Like other
	power systems, they must be tested to ensure correct commissioning, operation,
	and maintenance.</p>
	<p class="ex2">Typically a microgrid load bank test consists of both AC and DC
	load bank arrangements.</p>
	<p class="ex2">Load bank testing will indicate:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>An engine’s ability to provide the required power output</li>
		<li>Voltage regulator response times</li>
		<li>An alternator’s capability to provide the required voltage and the
		necessary frequency stability</li>
		<li>Performance of the control system under varying loads</li>
	</ul>
