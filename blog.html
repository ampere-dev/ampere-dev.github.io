            <time datetime="2025-08-30">August 30, 2025</time>
            <p>As the United States grapples with an unprecedented surge in electricity demand driven by AI data centers, the nation’s largest power grid, PJM Interconnection, is teetering on the edge of collapse. On August 28, 2025, the Department of Energy (DOE), under President Donald Trump’s leadership, issued an emergency order to extend the operation of units at the Pennsylvania Eddystone Generating Station, a critical step to prevent blackouts in the PJM region. This move highlights a growing energy crisis, exacerbated by policies that favored intermittent renewable energy over reliable baseload sources. With hyperscale AI data centers pushing grid limits, experts estimate the U.S. needs a 100-fold increase in power plant capacity to ensure grid resiliency. This article delves into the technical and economic dimensions of the crisis and Trump’s response. <a href="https://thelibertydaily.com/trump-steps-prevent-power-grid-collapsing-because-useless/"></a></p>

            <h3>The Crisis: AI Data Centers and Grid Strain</h3>
            <p>PJM Interconnection, serving 65 million people across 13 states and Washington, D.C., faces a dire supply-demand imbalance. The grid operator has issued nine energy emergency alerts since June 2025, driven by surging demand from AI data centers and heatwave-driven air conditioning loads. Hyperscale data centers, particularly in Northern Virginia’s “Data Center Alley,” consume 100–300 MW each, with modern AI server racks like Nvidia’s GB200 drawing 120 kW, double that of older models. The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects global data center electricity use will reach 1,000 TWh by 2026, equivalent to Japan’s annual consumption. In the U.S., data centers could account for 20% of electricity by 2030, up from 4% in 2022, per McKinsey & Company. <a href="https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/energy-power-supply/data-centers-need-own-power-supply-us-grid-watchdog-says"></a> <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-cost-of-compute-a-7-trillion-race-to-scale-data-centers"></a></p>
            <p>The DOE’s July 2025 grid reliability report warns that blackouts could increase 100-fold by 2030 if 104 GW of firm generation retires without adequate replacement. PJM expects a 70,000 MW summer peak increase to 220,000 MW by 2040, while 40 GW of coal and gas plants are slated to retire by 2030. Only 22 GW of new firm baseload generation is planned, leaving a massive dependable-capacity deficit. <a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/department-energy-releases-report-evaluating-us-grid-reliability-and-security"></a></p>[](https://www.energy.gov/articles/department-energy-releases-report-evaluating-us-grid-reliability-and-security)

            <h3>Trump’s Emergency Intervention: Technical Details</h3>
            <p>The DOE’s August 28 order, invoking Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act, compels Constellation Energy to keep Units 3 and 4 at the Eddystone Generating Station (820 MW total capacity) operational beyond their May 31, 2025, retirement date. These 380 MW subcritical steam turbine units, commissioned in the 1960s and 1970s, can run on natural gas or oil, offering flexibility during peak demand or fuel price volatility. The order, extended from May 30, mandates PJM to use economic dispatch to minimize costs and requires daily reporting to ensure compliance with environmental regulations. It expires November 26, 2025, but signals a broader strategy to preserve critical generation. <a href="https://www.powermag.com/trump-administration-issues-third-emergency-order-to-prevent-pjm-power-shortfall"></a></p>[](https://www.powermag.com/trump-administration-issues-third-emergency-order-to-prevent-pjm-power-shortfall/)
            <p>This follows similar DOE orders, including one on August 21 to keep a Michigan coal plant running, reflecting Trump’s push to reverse retirements of reliable baseload sources. The administration’s April 8 Executive Order (EO 14262) directs the DOE to develop a uniform methodology for assessing reserve margins and preventing the closure of essential power plants, prioritizing grid reliability and national security. The methodology evaluates outage risks based on frequency, magnitude, and duration, revealing a 30-fold risk increase even without retirements. <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2025/04/08/executive-order-strengthening-the-reliability-and-security-of-the-united-states-electric-grid"></a> <a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/department-energy-releases-report-evaluating-us-grid-reliability-and-security"></a></p>[](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/strengthening-the-reliability-and-security-of-the-united-states-electric-grid/)[](https://www.energy.gov/articles/department-energy-releases-report-evaluating-us-grid-reliability-and-security)

            <h3>Economic Impacts: Soaring Costs and Consumer Burden</h3>
            <p>PJM’s capacity auctions reflect the crisis’s economic toll. The 2025 auction hit $16.1 billion, up from $14.7 billion, with capacity prices per megawatt-day at $329.17, a record high. Last year’s 600% price spike led to a settlement with Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, saving consumers $21 billion over two years by capping increases. Despite this, electricity rates have risen 15% since 2020, with projections of 20–30% increases in PJM’s region by 2030, driven by data center demand and grid upgrades. In Virginia, a December 2024 report estimates residents could see annual bill increases of $276 by 2030 due to data centers, potentially higher if projects are delayed. <a href="https://thelibertydaily.com/trump-steps-prevent-power-grid-collapsing-because-useless/"></a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/14/business/energy-environment/ai-data-centers-electricity-costs.html"></a></p>[](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/14/business/energy-environment/ai-data-centers-electricity-costs.html)
            <p>Independent power producers like Constellation, Talen Energy, NRG, and Vistra have invested $34 billion in 2025, primarily in natural gas plants, capitalizing on demand. However, consumers and small businesses face the burden, with states like Maryland warning of rolling blackouts. The DOE notes that grid upgrades and new generation could cost $1–$2 trillion by 2030, with ratepayers likely sharing the load unless regulators force tech companies to cover costs. <a href="https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/energy-power-supply/record-breaking-data-center-demand-collides-critical-grid-limitations"></a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/14/business/energy-environment/ai-data-centers-electricity-costs.html"></a></p>[](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/14/business/energy-environment/ai-data-centers-electricity-costs.html)

            <h3>The 100-Fold Power Plant Challenge</h3>
            <p>To meet AI data center demand and ensure grid resiliency, the U.S. needs a 100-fold increase in power plant capacity, according to energy experts. PJM’s 46 GW of approved projects are stalled by local opposition, supply chain issues, and financing, exacerbating the crisis. A single hyperscale data center requires 1–3 GW, and with 7.8 GW under construction and 31.6 GW planned in North America, the grid needs massive expansion. The DOE’s July report projects annual outage hours could rise from single digits to over 800 by 2030 without firm generation. Natural gas (40% of U.S. electricity) and nuclear are critical, with projects like Microsoft’s contract to restart Three Mile Island’s Crane Clean Energy Center (2027) and Amazon’s $20 billion nuclear-backed data center in Pennsylvania showing promise. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/americas-largest-power-grid-is-struggling-meet-demand-ai-2025-07-09"></a> <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-ai-data-centers-energy-power-grid-0f3c8f0a0f3b0f0e4b0e4e0e4b0e4b0e"></a></p>[](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/americas-largest-power-grid-is-struggling-meet-demand-ai-2025-07-09/)[](https://apnews.com/article/trump-artificial-intelligence-energy-data-centers-f216660b80f992ae303b348dac0b2f87)
            <p>Small modular reactors (SMRs), delivering 1.5–300 MW, could provide scalable, carbon-neutral power by 2030. However, building 100 times the current firm capacity requires streamlining permitting, which Trump’s EO aims to achieve, and addressing supply chain bottlenecks. The cost could reach $3.7–$7.9 trillion, per McKinsey, necessitating public-private partnerships. <a href="https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/energy-power-supply/us-energy-experts-highlight-potential-nuclear-powered-data-centers"></a> <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-cost-of-compute-a-7-trillion-race-to-scale-data-centers"></a></p>

            <h3>Policy Clash: Green Goals vs. Reliability</h3>
            <p>Democratic governors like Phil Murphy (NJ), Wes Moore (MD), Josh Shapiro (PA), and Matt Meyer (DE) have pushed net-zero goals and coal phase-outs, which experts argue have strained PJM’s grid. André Béliveau of the Commonwealth Foundation told the Daily Caller News Foundation, “PJM has to work within the policy and political realities that they get from the states.” Amy Cooke of Always on Energy Research criticized these “unrealistic” net-zero policies, noting that retirements outpace new generation. Trump’s administration counters with a focus on “all-of-the-above” energy, including natural gas, nuclear, and coal, while axing regulations like the EPA’s Mercury and Air Toxics Standards to keep plants online. <a href="https://thelibertydaily.com/trump-steps-prevent-power-grid-collapsing-because-useless/"></a> <a href="https://www.esgdive.com/news/trump-coal-grid-reliability-ai/716013"></a></p>[](https://www.esgdive.com/news/trump-coal-executive-order-doe-power-plants-ai-grid-reliability/744990/)
            <p>Critics, like Sen. Ed Markey, argue that deregulation risks environmental harm, with data centers potentially polluting water and air via gas plants and diesel generators. However, renewable energy alone—80% of 2024’s new capacity—cannot meet AI’s constant demand due to intermittency, as noted by University of Pennsylvania’s Benjamin Lee. <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-ai-data-centers-energy-power-grid-0f3c8f0a0f3b0f0e4b0e4e0e4b0e4b0e"></a> <a href="https://fedscoop.com/trump-ai-plan-data-centers-energy-environmental-regulations"></a></p>[](https://apnews.com/article/trump-artificial-intelligence-energy-data-centers-f216660b80f992ae303b348dac0b2f87)[](https://fedscoop.com/trump-ai-action-play-energy-data-centers-grid/)

            <h3>The Path Forward: Balancing Innovation and Stability</h3>
            <p>Trump’s actions, including the January 20 National Energy Emergency declaration and streamlined permitting, aim to boost generation and transmission. However, challenges remain: PJM’s interconnection queue has over 2,000 delayed projects, and transmission lines need to quintuple capacity, per the DOE. Grid-enhancing technologies and demand management, as suggested in Trump’s AI Action Plan, could optimize existing infrastructure. Long-term, SMRs and public-private investments are critical to meeting the 100-fold capacity need while maintaining affordability. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/trumps-high-wire-act-transform-us-power-grid-wont-be-easy-2025-01-24"></a> <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/trumps-ai-plan-meets-a-stressed-american-electric-grid"></a></p>[](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/trumps-high-wire-act-transform-us-power-grid-wont-be-easy-2025-01-24/)[](https://www.eenews.net/articles/trumps-ai-plan-meets-a-stressed-american-electric-grid/)
            <p>Consumers face tough choices, with energy efficiency measures and demand response programs offering short-term relief. Without bold action, the AI-driven energy crisis could lead to widespread outages and crippling costs, threatening economic and national security.</p>

            <time datetime="2025-08-19">August 19, 2025</time>
            <p>The global data center industry is on the cusp of a transformative era, with capital expenditures projected to exceed $1 trillion by 2030, driven by the explosive growth of AI-driven workloads. At Data Center World 2025, Omdia analyst Vlad Galabov outlined the sector’s critical challenges—power distribution, cooling, and talent shortages—while emphasizing that these hurdles are solvable with innovative solutions and long-term thinking. Drawing inspiration from Steve Jobs and Elon Musk’s mastery of signal-to-noise ratio planning and relentless focus, this article explores how the data center industry can navigate this trillion-dollar challenge with clarity and precision. <a href="https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/data-center-hardware/omdia-s-vlad-galabov-on-navigating-the-trillion-dollar-data-center-challenge"></a></p>[](https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/data-center-hardware/omdia-s-vlad-galabov-on-navigating-the-trillion-dollar-data-center-challenge)

            <h3>The Data Center Boom: A Trillion-Dollar Opportunity</h3>
            <p>The data center market is experiencing unprecedented demand, with AI workloads projected to account for 27% of total power consumption by the end of 2025, according to Omdia’s Vlad Galabov. The global market is expected to reach $1 trillion in capital expenditure by 2030, a figure Galabov calls conservative. This growth is fueled by the rise of AI, cloud computing, and digital infrastructure, with 7.8 GW of data center capacity under construction in North America alone in the first half of 2025, per JLL’s midyear report. However, power constraints, aging grid infrastructure, and a shortage of skilled talent threaten to derail this expansion. <a href="https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/data-center-hardware/omdia-s-vlad-galabov-on-navigating-the-trillion-dollar-data-center-challenge"></a> <a href="https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/energy-power-supply/record-breaking-data-center-demand-collides-critical-grid-limitations"></a></p>[](https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/data-center-hardware/omdia-s-vlad-galabov-on-navigating-the-trillion-dollar-data-center-challenge)[](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250421140248/en/Data-Center-World-2025-Grew-by-Over-70-Brought-the-Data-Center-Ecosystem-Together-to-Discuss-the-Future-of-Data-Centers-and-Digital-Infrastructure)

            <h3>Signal-to-Noise Ratio: Cutting Through the Chaos</h3>
            <p>Steve Jobs and Elon Musk are renowned for their ability to filter out noise—distractions, short-term trends, and irrelevant data—to focus on the signal: the core problem or opportunity. Jobs applied this philosophy at Apple, prioritizing simplicity and user experience over feature bloat. Musk employs it at Tesla and SpaceX, tackling complex challenges like battery scalability or reusable rockets with laser-like focus. Galabov echoes this approach, urging the data center industry to “ignore the noise” of tariffs, supply chain shocks, and geopolitical volatility and concentrate on scalable, sustainable solutions. <a href="https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/data-center-hardware/omdia-s-vlad-galabov-on-navigating-the-trillion-dollar-data-center-challenge"></a></p>[](https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/data-center-hardware/omdia-s-vlad-galabov-on-navigating-the-trillion-dollar-data-center-challenge)
            <p>For data centers, the signal is clear: power availability and efficiency are the primary barriers to growth. With grid connection wait times averaging four years and commercial electricity costs up 30% since 2020, operators must focus on innovative power solutions like behind-the-meter natural gas turbines, retrofitting stranded capacity, and exploring small modular reactors (SMRs) for long-term, carbon-neutral energy. <a href="https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/energy-power-supply/record-breaking-data-center-demand-collides-critical-grid-limitations"></a></p>[](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250421140248/en/Data-Center-World-2025-Grew-by-Over-70-Brought-the-Data-Center-Ecosystem-Together-to-Discuss-the-Future-of-Data-Centers-and-Digital-Infrastructure)

            <h3>Power Challenges and Emerging Solutions</h3>
            <p>PJM Interconnection, the largest U.S. grid serving 65 million people, is under strain from data centers, particularly in Northern Virginia’s “Data Center Alley.” Monitoring Analytics’ August 2025 report recommends requiring large data centers to generate their own power, as the grid lacks spare capacity. Solutions like natural gas turbines, which can deliver power in months, and battery energy storage systems (BESS) paired with renewables are gaining traction. By 2030, SMRs could provide 1.5–300 MW of scalable power, transforming the industry. <a href="https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/energy-power-supply/data-centers-need-own-power-supply-us-grid-watchdog-says"></a></p>[](https://www.7x24exchange.org/7x24-news/data-centers-industry-news/)
            <p>Cooling is another critical challenge, as AI server racks like Nvidia’s GB200 consume 120 kW, doubling the power draw of older models. Omdia predicts liquid cooling will account for one-third of the market by 2027, up from one-seventh today, with direct-to-chip and immersion technologies leading the way. These solutions align with Jobs’ focus on elegant, efficient design and Musk’s push for scalable innovation. <a href="https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/energy-power-supply/omdia-analysts-discuss-powering-and-cooling-the-ai-revolution"></a></p>[](https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/cooling/omdia-analysts-discuss-powering-and-cooling-the-ai-revolution)

            <h3>The Talent Crunch: A Human Infrastructure Challenge</h3>
            <p>Beyond power and cooling, the industry faces a talent shortage. Galabov highlights the need for skilled workers to design, build, and operate next-generation data centers. Musk’s approach at SpaceX—building interdisciplinary teams and fostering a culture of problem-solving—offers a model. Data center operators can invest in training programs and partnerships with universities to cultivate talent, ensuring the industry can scale with demand. Jobs’ emphasis on hiring passionate, creative individuals also applies, as the sector needs innovative thinkers to tackle complex infrastructure challenges.</p>

            <h3>Market Dynamics: Investment and Expansion</h3>
            <p>Investment in data centers is surging, with $13.4 billion in asset-backed securities and loans in the first half of 2025, per JLL. McKinsey estimates AI-related data center capacity could require $3.7–$7.9 trillion by 2030, depending on supply chain and technological factors. Northern Virginia remains the largest market, but growth is spilling into secondary markets like Richmond, Northwest Indiana, and West Texas due to power availability. This mirrors Musk’s strategy of iterating rapidly and scaling infrastructure to meet demand, as seen in Tesla’s Gigafactory expansion. <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-cost-of-compute-a-7-trillion-race-to-scale-data-centers"></a> <a href="https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/energy-power-supply/record-breaking-data-center-demand-collides-critical-grid-limitations"></a></p>[](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/the-cost-of-compute-a-7-trillion-dollar-race-to-scale-data-centers)[](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250421140248/en/Data-Center-World-2025-Grew-by-Over-70-Brought-the-Data-Center-Ecosystem-Together-to-Discuss-the-Future-of-Data-Centers-and-Digital-Infrastructure)

            <h3>Long-Term Focus: Building a Sustainable Future</h3>
            <p>Galabov’s call for long-term thinking resonates with Jobs and Musk’s ability to envision transformative futures. Jobs simplified technology to create intuitive products; Musk reimagined transportation and space exploration. For data centers, this means prioritizing sustainability and scalability. Digitalized infrastructure, AI-optimized power usage effectiveness (PUE), and modular data centers—projected to reach $11.7 billion by 2027—offer paths forward. Operators must also collaborate on standards, as Christian Belady noted at Data Center World 2025, to avoid “boutique solutions” and ensure interoperability. <a href="https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/energy-power-supply/modular-data-center-market-growth-accelerated-by-ai-omdia"></a> <a href="https://www.channelfutures.com/data-centers/ai-data-center-growth-point-to-big-channel-opportunity"></a></p>[](https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/modular-data-centers/modular-data-center-market-growth-accelerated-by-ai-omdia-)[](https://www.channelfutures.com/data-centers/ai-data-center-growth-point-big-channel-opportunity)
            <p>The industry must balance rapid growth with environmental responsibility. Data centers currently consume 176 TWh annually, projected to rise to 325–580 TWh by 2027. Innovations like liquid cooling and SMRs can reduce carbon footprints, aligning with global sustainability goals. <a href="https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/energy-power-supply/data-center-world-2025-industry-gathers-to-tackle-power-ai-scaling-challenges"></a></p>[](https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/energy-power-supply/data-center-world-2025-industry-gathers-to-tackle-power-ai-scaling-challenges)

            <h3>The Path Ahead: Clarity Amid Complexity</h3>
            <p>The trillion-dollar data center challenge is daunting but navigable with a Jobs-Musk mindset: focus on the signal—power, cooling, and talent—while ignoring short-term noise like tariffs or geopolitical disruptions. By investing in self-generated energy, advanced cooling, and workforce development, the industry can meet AI-driven demand. As Galabov notes, “most of the problems are solvable” with resilience and strategic planning. The data center sector stands at the forefront of the next industrial revolution, and with visionary focus, it can power the AI-driven future without breaking the grid or the bank.</p>

        <div class="post-content">
            <time datetime="2025-08-19">August 19, 2025</time>
            <p>The rapid expansion of data centers, driven by the AI boom, is pushing America’s largest power grid to its breaking point. PJM Interconnection, serving 65 million people across 13 states from Virginia to Illinois, lacks the capacity to support new data centers, according to Monitoring Analytics, the grid’s independent watchdog. In a significant escalation, their latest quarterly report recommends that large data centers be required to generate their own power, signaling a critical shift in how the industry must address its soaring energy demands.</p>

            <h3>A Grid Under Siege: The Data Center Surge</h3>
            <p>PJM’s grid, home to the highest concentration of data centers in the U.S., is buckling under the unprecedented power demands of AI-driven facilities, particularly in Northern Virginia’s “Data Center Alley.” Modern AI server racks, such as Nvidia’s GB200, consume 120 kW—double the power of older models—leading to hyperscale data centers requiring 100–300 megawatts, enough to power small cities. The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects global data center electricity consumption will double by 2026, reaching over 1,000 terawatt-hours, comparable to Japan’s annual energy use. <a href="https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/energy-power-supply/data-centers-need-own-power-supply-us-grid-watchdog-says"></a></p>[](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/data-centers-bring-own-power-192108869.html)
            <p>“The current supply of capacity in PJM is not adequate to meet the demand from large data center loads and will not be adequate in the foreseeable future,” Monitoring Analytics stated in its August 14 report. Joe Bowring, president of the watchdog, emphasized, “There is simply no new capacity to meet new loads,” urging data center developers to build their own power plants to avoid overwhelming the grid. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-14/data-centers-need-to-bring-own-power-supply-grid-watchdog-says"></a></p>[](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-14/data-centers-need-to-bring-own-power-supply-grid-watchdog-says)

            <h3>From Suggestion to Mandate: A Policy Shift</h3>
            <p>Just a month ago, Monitoring Analytics suggested that data center operators consider building their own generation. The latest report takes a firmer stance, recommending a requirement for large data centers to provide their own power. This shift reflects the severity of the crisis, as PJM’s aging infrastructure struggles to keep up with demand, driving up costs for consumers and sparking political controversy. The grid operator reported $16.1 billion in capacity costs for 2026, up from $14.7 billion last year, with prices per megawatt-day hitting a record $329.17. <a href="https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/energy-power-supply/data-centers-need-own-power-supply-us-grid-watchdog-says"></a></p>[](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/data-centers-bring-own-power-192108869.html)
            <p>PJM acknowledged the challenge, stating it is working with stakeholders to address the supply-demand imbalance driven by “unprecedented growth in electricity use.” Without action, the watchdog warns, other PJM customers could face “very high costs” as data centers strain the system further.</p>

            <h3>Why the Grid Can’t Cope</h3>
            <p>The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) notes that only 15% of new electricity capacity in 2024 came from renewables, with natural gas and coal filling the gap as coal and nuclear plants retire. Over 20% of PJM’s generating capacity is set to retire by 2030, exacerbating the shortage. The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) projects a high risk of power shortages in PJM’s region by 2027 if demand continues to outpace supply. Data centers could account for 20% of U.S. electricity by 2030, up from 4% today, according to McKinsey & Company. <a href="https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/energy-power-supply/data-centers-need-own-power-supply-us-grid-watchdog-says"></a></p>[](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/data-centers-bring-own-power-192108869.html)
            <p>In Maryland, officials have warned of potential rolling blackouts, unable to rely solely on imported power. Pennsylvania recently intervened to stabilize Maryland’s grid, highlighting regional vulnerabilities.

    <h2 onclick="togglePost(this)"><a href="#HyperGrid-AI-Nuclear-Campus">HyperGrid: Powering the AI Revolution with Nuclear Energy in Texas</a></h2>
    <div class="post-content">
        <time datetime="2025-08-04">August 4, 2025</time>
        <p>In a bold move to address the surging energy demands of artificial intelligence (AI), Fermi America has partnered with South Korea’s Hyundai Engineering & Construction (E&C) to develop the HyperGrid, a groundbreaking 5,769-acre energy and AI campus near Amarillo, Texas. This ambitious project, backed by former Texas Governor and U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry and investor Toby Neugebauer, aims to deliver up to 11 gigawatts (GW) of power by integrating nuclear, natural gas, solar, and battery storage, positioning Texas as a global leader in AI infrastructure. With construction set to begin in 2026, the HyperGrid could redefine how data centers meet the energy needs of next-generation computing.</p>
        
        <h3>A Vision for the Future: The HyperGrid Campus</h3>
        <p>The HyperGrid, developed in collaboration with the Texas Tech University System, is designed to be the world’s largest private power grid, delivering behind-the-meter power to hyperscale data centers. The campus will feature four Westinghouse AP1000 nuclear reactors, each capable of generating over 1 GW, alongside 4 GW of combined-cycle natural gas turbines, 600 MW of solar arrays, and battery storage. Located near the Pantex nuclear weapons facility in the Texas Panhandle, the project leverages the region’s abundant natural gas reserves and high solar irradiance to create a resilient, hybrid energy ecosystem. Geotechnical work has already begun, with 1 GW of capacity expected online by the end of 2026, primarily from gas turbines, and the first nuclear reactor targeted for operation by 2032.</p>[](https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/04/fermi_america_nuclear_datacenter/)[](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/hyundai-to-deliver-nuclear-power-to-fermi-americas-11gw-ai-campus-in-amarillo-texas/)
        
        <h3>Hyundai E&C’s Proven Expertise</h3>
        <p>Hyundai E&C brings a wealth of experience to the HyperGrid, having successfully constructed 18 nuclear reactors in South Korea and four at the Barakah Nuclear Power Plant in the United Arab Emirates, a project delivered on time and within budget. With two reactors under construction in South Korea and two in the engineering phase in Bulgaria, Hyundai’s track record makes it a critical partner. The memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed in Seoul outlines joint planning, front-end engineering design (FEED), and an engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contract to be finalized by year-end 2025. “We need proven partners like Hyundai, who have a successful track record of planning and building safe, clean, new nuclear energy,” said Fermi co-founder Toby Neugebauer.</p>[](https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/04/fermi_america_nuclear_datacenter/)[](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fermi-america-to-partner-with-hyundai-engineering--construction-to-develop-nuclear-component-of-worlds-largest-first-of-its-kind-private-grid-for-next-generation-ai-302517759.html)
        
        <h3>Meeting AI’s Insatiable Energy Demand</h3>
        <p>The HyperGrid responds to a structural shift in U.S. energy consumption, with AI-driven data centers, reindustrialization, and electrification pushing annual electricity demand growth above 3% through 2040, according to a 2025 McKinsey energy study. Data centers alone could double global electricity demand by 2026, straining grids like PJM Interconnection, which saw capacity prices spike to $329.17/MW-day in its 2026/2027 auction. By generating power on-site, HyperGrid sidesteps transmission bottlenecks, offering hyperscalers a stable, cost-effective energy supply. Fermi has acquired 600 MW of gas generators, including Siemens Energy SGT800 turbines and refurbished GE Frame 6B units, which are 30% cleaner than the current grid and equipped with emissions-reducing technologies.</p>[](https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/04/fermi_america_nuclear_datacenter/)[](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/fermi-america-acquires-600mw-of-gas-turbines-for-11gw-ai-mega-campus-in-amarillo-texas/)[](https://www.rudebaguette.com/en/2025/08/ai-data-farms-to-run-on-nuclear-power-in-us-first-hypergrid-a-dangerous-gamble-or-the-future-of-tech/)
        
        <h3>Challenges and Opportunities</h3>
        <p>While ambitious, the HyperGrid faces significant hurdles. A single AP1000 reactor was estimated at $6.8 billion in 2023, but cost overruns and delays are common, as seen with the Vogtle plant in Georgia, which cost $36 billion and took 15 years to complete. Fermi’s target of completing four reactors by 2032 is aggressive, even with Hyundai’s expertise and a streamlined Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) review, which accepted Fermi’s Combined Operating License Application on June 17, 2025. Financing remains undisclosed, though Fermi is seeking funds from Texas’ $350 million nuclear energy fund and engaging hyperscalers like Amazon and Microsoft, which are investing heavily in AI infrastructure.</p>[](https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/04/fermi_america_nuclear_datacenter/)[](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/06/26/nuclear-artificial-intelligence-datacenters-trump/)[](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/energy/article/rick-perry-nuclear-power-trump-20397370.php)
        <p>The project also explores small modular reactors (SMRs) for up to 2.5 GW, though only NuScale’s design is currently NRC-approved. Water usage, a concern in the drought-prone Panhandle, will be mitigated through closed-loop cooling systems, air-cooled condensers, and non-potable water sources, with solar-covered retention ponds to reduce evaporation. These innovations align with Fermi’s goal of creating the “cleanest, greenest grid on the planet.”</p>[](https://www.amarillo.com/story/news/2025/07/10/fermi-300b-ai-campus-brings-jobs-clean-energy-to-amarillo/84509082007/)
        
        <h3>Economic and Strategic Impact</h3>
        <p>The HyperGrid is poised to transform Amarillo into a global AI hub, creating thousands of jobs and fostering academic partnerships through Texas Tech. The project’s $300 billion investment could generate a $19.2 billion economic impact, similar to the Texas Tech University System’s statewide contribution. By combining nuclear, gas, and renewables, HyperGrid offers a model for energy-secure AI campuses, positioning the U.S. to compete with China, which initiated 94.5 GW of coal capacity and operates 58 nuclear reactors in 2024. “The Chinese are building 22 nuclear reactors today to power the future of AI. America has none,” said Rick Perry, emphasizing the urgency of the project.</p>[](https://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/nuclear-data-tech-energy-fermi-20399632.php)[](https://www.amarillo.com/story/news/2025/07/10/fermi-300b-ai-campus-brings-jobs-clean-energy-to-amarillo/84509082007/)
        
        <h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
        <p>The HyperGrid represents a bold step toward integrating nuclear power with AI infrastructure, addressing the energy bottleneck threatening America’s technological dominance. If successful, it could serve as a blueprint for future projects, reviving U.S. nuclear development dormant since the 1970s. However, its success hinges on overcoming regulatory, financial, and logistical challenges. As Fermi and Hyundai refine their plans, the HyperGrid could redefine how the U.S. powers the AI revolution, ensuring a reliable, sustainable energy future.</p>[](https://www.webpronews.com/fermi-america-hyundai-partner-for-5gw-nuclear-grid-to-power-ai-in-texas/)

    <h2 onclick="togglePost(this)"><a href="#PJM-Auction-Crisis-2025">Grid on the Brink: PJM’s 2026/2027 Auction Signals Urgent Need for Reliable Power</a></h2>
    <div class="post-content">
        <time datetime="2025-08-01">August 1, 2025</time>
        <p>On July 22, 2025, PJM Interconnection, the largest U.S. grid operator serving 67 million people across 13 states and Washington, D.C., released the results of its 2026/2027 Base Residual Auction (BRA). The outcome was a stark warning: capacity prices hit the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) cap of $329.17 per megawatt-day (MW-day) across all zones, a 22% increase from the previous year’s $269.92/MW-day. This unprecedented price spike, totaling $16.1 billion in capacity payments, underscores a growing crisis in America’s power grid, driven by surging demand, retiring baseload generation, and delays in new capacity. The auction results highlight the critical role of coal and other dispatchable energy sources in maintaining grid reliability.</p>
        
        <h3>A Distress Signal from the Grid</h3>
        <p>The 2026/2027 BRA secured 134,311 MW of unforced capacity (UCAP), with an additional 11,933 MW through Fixed Resource Requirement utilities, ensuring enough power to meet peak demand plus a reserve margin. However, the auction clearing at the FERC price cap signals a market in distress, unable to balance supply and demand without extreme costs. PJM’s forecasted peak load for 2026/2027 is 5,400 MW higher than the previous year, driven by data center expansion, electrification of vehicles and buildings, and industrial growth. Meanwhile, the rapid retirement of coal and gas plants—nearly 100,000 MW of coal capacity lost over the past 15 years—has outpaced new generation, leaving only 139 MW of excess capacity above reliability requirements.</p>
        
        <h3>The Dominance of Dispatchable Power</h3>
        <p>Despite mandates requiring renewable and battery projects to participate, the auction’s cleared capacity relied heavily on dispatchable sources: natural gas (45%), coal (22%), nuclear (21%), hydro (4%), with wind and solar contributing just 3% and 1%, respectively. This mix reflects the reality that intermittent renewables struggle to provide reliable power during peak demand, such as during heatwaves or winter storms. Coal’s role was bolstered by an 867 MW UCAP increase, partly due to Reliability Must-Run (RMR) units like Maryland’s Herbert Wagner and Brandon Shores plants, which were kept online through 2029 after PJM flagged their retirement as a reliability risk.</p>
        <p>The auction also saw 17 generating units, totaling 1,100 MW, withdraw retirement plans since the 2025/2026 BRA, responding to market signals. Investors are taking note: shares of Talen Energy, a major coal and gas operator, surged 9%, while Constellation Energy, with nuclear and fossil assets, rose 5%. These trends underscore the enduring value of baseload generation in a grid under strain.</p>
        
        <h3>Policy Missteps and Rising Demand</h3>
        <p>The crisis stems from a confluence of factors: premature retirements of coal and nuclear plants, driven by state policies and economic pressures, and a failure to replace them quickly enough. For example, New York’s closure of the Indian Point nuclear plant has strained its grid, prompting consideration of new nuclear facilities. PJM’s interconnection queue, with 286 GW of mostly renewable projects, is plagued by delays, with 46,000 MW of approved projects stalled by permitting, supply chain issues, and financing challenges. Only 2,669 MW of new generation and uprates cleared in the 2026/2027 auction, far short of what’s needed to offset retirements.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, demand is skyrocketing. The International Energy Agency projects that data centers could double global electricity demand by 2026, with PJM’s “Data Center Alley” in Northern Virginia driving much of this growth. Electrification mandates and industrial expansion further exacerbate the strain, pushing PJM’s 2025/2026 peak load forecast to 153,883 MW, up 3,243 MW from the prior year.</p>
        
        <h3>The Case for Coal and Baseload Power</h3>
        <p>The auction’s results challenge the narrative that renewables alone can meet America’s energy needs. Coal plants, with their 40–60-year lifespans and on-site fuel storage, offer unmatched reliability compared to gas pipelines vulnerable to disruptions or intermittent renewables dependent on weather. Globally, countries like China, which initiated 94.5 GW of coal capacity in 2024, and India recognize this, building coal plants to support economic growth. In contrast, U.S. policies have sidelined coal, leading to a supply-demand imbalance that threatens blackouts and energy poverty.</p>
        <p>PJM’s Reliability Resource Initiative (RRI) is a step toward addressing this, attracting 11,000 MW of planned projects, including gas, nuclear, and battery storage. Reforms like the Surplus Interconnection Service (SIS) aim to utilize existing grid capacity for new generators, such as pairing renewables with battery storage. However, these measures face hurdles, including a three-year closure of PJM’s interconnection queue, which prevents new projects from entering until 2026.</p>
        
        <h3>Economic and Social Impacts</h3>
        <p>The auction’s high prices will likely increase electricity bills by 1.5% to 5% starting June 2026, with some Pennsylvania businesses facing up to 29% hikes. These costs, while a small fraction of total bills, reflect the growing risk of grid failure. Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, frustrated by the 833% price surge in the 2025/2026 auction, negotiated a FERC-approved price cap reduction from $500/MW-day to $325/MW-day, saving consumers an estimated $21 billion. Yet, Shapiro’s threat to exit PJM highlights a broader “crisis of confidence” among state leaders, as noted by ClearView Energy Partners.</p>
        <p>Without action, the U.S. risks California- or Texas-style blackouts, with outages costing millions per hour and disproportionately affecting vulnerable communities. The North American Electric Reliability Corporation warns of elevated blackout risks across much of the country, driven by similar supply-demand imbalances.</p>
        
        <h3>A Path Forward: Pragmatism Over Ideology</h3>
        <p>To avert a reliability crisis, the U.S. must prioritize dispatchable generation. This means extending the life of existing coal and nuclear plants through upgrades, such as improved emissions controls and turbines, and building new baseload capacity. Coal’s resilience—immune to pipeline disruptions and geopolitical volatility—makes it a strategic asset, as evidenced by its 22% share in the 2026/2027 auction. Streamlining interconnection processes, as PJM is attempting through its FERC-approved reforms, is also critical to bring new capacity online faster.</p>
        <p>The auction’s $16.1 billion price tag is a wake-up call: energy policy must balance environmental goals with reliability and affordability. By investing in coal, nuclear, and natural gas alongside renewables, the U.S. can ensure a stable grid capable of meeting the demands of the AI era, electrification, and economic growth.</p>

    <h2 onclick="togglePost(this)"><a href="#US-Energy-Flows-2023">Tracking America’s Energy Evolution: Insights from the 2023 LLNL Energy Flow Chart</a></h2>
    <div class="post-content">
        <time datetime="2025-08-01">August 1, 2025</time>
        <p>The United States’ energy landscape is undergoing a profound transformation, as detailed in the 2023 U.S. energy flow chart released by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL). These charts, known as Sankey diagrams, have been a cornerstone of energy analysis since the 1970s, offering a visual representation of the nation’s energy production, consumption, and waste. The 2023 chart, available at <a href="https://flowcharts.llnl.gov">flowcharts.llnl.gov</a>, reveals a total energy consumption of 93.6 quadrillion British Thermal Units (BTUs), or quads, with significant shifts toward cleaner energy sources and a reduction in fossil fuel use, signaling progress in the nation’s decarbonization efforts.</p>
        
        <h3>Understanding the 2023 Energy Flow Chart</h3>
        <p>LLNL’s Sankey diagrams are single-page visualizations that map the flow of energy from sources—such as solar, nuclear, hydroelectric, wind, geothermal, natural gas, coal, biomass, and petroleum—to their end uses in residential, commercial, industrial, and transportation sectors. The 2023 chart shows that of the 93.6 quads consumed, approximately 60% (56.2 quads) was wasted as “rejected energy” due to inefficiencies in power plants, vehicles, and buildings, while 37.4 quads were converted into useful energy services. This persistent inefficiency underscores the need for advanced technologies to optimize energy use.</p>[](https://www.llnl.gov/tags/energy-flow-charts)
        <p>The chart highlights a notable trend: Americans reduced their consumption of electricity and fossil fuels in 2023 compared to previous years, while increasing reliance on carbon-free energy sources like solar, wind, and nuclear. For instance, solar and wind power saw significant gains, with solar increasing by 23% and wind by 5% from 2021 to 2023, reflecting broader adoption of renewables across the energy supply sector.</p>
        
        <h3>Shifting Energy Sources: A Move Toward Renewables</h3>
        <p>The 2023 data illustrates a continued pivot away from fossil fuels. Natural gas remained a dominant source, contributing 32.6 quads, primarily for electricity generation and industrial use, but its share has slightly declined. Coal usage dropped to 11.9 quads, a significant decrease from its 2019 peak of 15.7 quads, driven by the retirement of coal-fired power plants. Petroleum, used heavily in transportation (26.8 quads), also saw a modest reduction. Meanwhile, renewable energy sources are gaining ground: solar contributed 2.1 quads, wind 3.8 quads, and hydroelectric 2.4 quads, collectively accounting for over 10% of the energy mix. Nuclear power, providing 8.1 quads, remains a steady source of carbon-free electricity.</p>[](https://www.llnl.gov/tags/energy-flow-charts)
        <p>This shift aligns with broader decarbonization trends. According to an LLNL news release, the nation’s carbon dioxide emissions decreased in 2023, driven by increased renewable energy adoption and reduced fossil fuel consumption. However, state-level trends vary, with states like California and Texas showing significant solar growth (21% and 57% increases from 2016 to 2017, respectively), while others lag in transitioning to cleaner sources.</p>[](https://www.llnl.gov/article/46601/carbon-emissions-energy-flow-charts-all-us-states)
        
        <h3>The Role of Sankey Diagrams in Energy Analysis</h3>
        <p>Since the mid-1970s, LLNL has produced Sankey diagrams to help scientists, policymakers, and the public understand the complex interrelationships in energy systems. These diagrams, built on data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), use proportional arrows to depict energy flows, with the width of each arrow indicating the magnitude of energy transfer. For example, the 2023 chart shows that 9.99 quads of natural gas were used for electricity generation, while only 0.5 quads powered transportation, highlighting the fuel’s distinct role in the economy.</p>[](https://www.e-education.psu.edu/marcellus/node/845)
        <p>Beyond energy, LLNL has expanded its flow charts to include carbon and water flows at national, state, and organizational levels, providing critical insights for resource management. These tools are widely used by federal and state agencies, energy researchers, educators, and industry leaders to identify inefficiencies, underused resources, and opportunities for technological advancements.</p>
        
        <h3>Challenges and Opportunities in the Energy Transition</h3>
        <p>Despite progress, the 2023 chart reveals persistent challenges. The high level of rejected energy (56.2 quads) highlights inefficiencies in current technologies, particularly in power generation and transportation. For instance, only 30% of energy used in electricity generation is converted to useful services, with the rest lost as heat. This inefficiency is compounded by the growing energy demands of AI-driven data centers, which are projected to double global electricity consumption by 2026. In the U.S., data centers in regions like Northern Virginia’s “Data Center Alley” are straining grids, with PJM Interconnection reporting an 800% spike in power capacity costs in 2024 due to hyperscaler demand.</p>
        <p>To address these challenges, investments in grid modernization and renewable energy are critical. The U.S. Department of Energy estimates that upgrading aging infrastructure—70% of transmission lines are over 25 years old—could reduce energy waste and support the integration of renewables. Innovations like high-voltage DC power delivery and liquid cooling for data centers are also essential to meet the needs of high-density computing environments.</p>[](https://flowcharts.llnl.gov/)
        
        <h3>Looking Ahead: A Path to Sustainability</h3>
        <p>The 2023 LLNL energy flow chart underscores the U.S.’s progress toward a decarbonized energy system, with renewables and nuclear power playing larger roles. However, achieving a sustainable future requires addressing inefficiencies, accelerating the deployment of clean energy technologies, and modernizing the grid to handle rising demands from AI, electric vehicles, and electrification. By leveraging insights from Sankey diagrams, policymakers and industry leaders can prioritize investments in energy efficiency, renewable capacity, and resilient infrastructure to ensure a reliable and sustainable energy future.</p>

    <div class="post-content">
        <time datetime="2025-08-01">August 1, 2025</time>
        <p>The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance computing (HPC) is transforming data center infrastructure, pushing operators to adopt power-intensive technologies like 1 MW IT racks. These advancements, driven by the need to support next-generation AI workloads, are reshaping not only data center architecture but also the supply chains that sustain them. With hyperscalers projected to control 60% of global data center capacity by 2030, the urgency to deliver scalable, resilient, and agile supply chains has never been greater.</p>
        
        <h3>The Dawn of 1 MW Racks: A Paradigm Shift</h3>
        <p>Innovations in chip design and computing power are paving the way for 1 MW IT racks, capable of handling unprecedented AI and HPC workloads. Industry leaders like NVIDIA predict that AI racks could consume 600 kW by 2027, with 1 MW racks becoming mainstream by the decade’s end. Early pilots are already underway, showcasing racks that compute at the equivalent of 20 traditional 50 kW racks. This leap in density introduces significant challenges, including massive power consumption and extreme heat generation, necessitating new approaches to power delivery, cooling, and supply chain management.</p>
        <p>Three critical innovations are driving this transition:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>High-voltage DC power delivery:</strong> Traditional 48–54 V DC systems are being replaced by +/-400 V DC distribution, with 800 V high-voltage DC (HVDC) systems on the horizon to support high-density environments.</li>
            <li><strong>Advanced liquid cooling:</strong> Direct-to-chip liquid cooling systems are becoming essential to manage the thermal loads of AI and HPC racks, offering superior efficiency over air-based solutions.</li>
            <li><strong>Power and compute disaggregation:</strong> By relocating power conversion and delivery to adjacent “sidecar” racks, operators can optimize compute density, enhance thermal management, and improve power efficiency.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Supply Chain Challenges in the AI Era</h3>
        <p>The shift to 1 MW racks amplifies the complexity of data center supply chains. Unlike traditional data centers, which spread risk across distributed systems, AI-driven facilities rely on centralized, interdependent architectures. This introduces several risks:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Single points of failure:</strong> A single supplier’s disruption could impact significantly more applications due to the reliance on fewer, high-capacity systems.</li>
            <li><strong>Customized components:</strong> Vendor-specific parts, such as advanced GPUs or liquid cooling manifolds, often have longer lead times and limited interoperability.</li>
            <li><strong>Retooling requirements:</strong> New power and cooling products may require additional testing, certification, and integration, delaying deployments.</li>
            <li><strong>Logistics hurdles:</strong> Integrated 1 MW racks are larger and heavier, complicating shipping and handling compared to traditional systems.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>According to a 2024 Gartner report, 70% of data center operators cite supply chain delays as a top concern, with lead times for specialized components like high-voltage power supplies extending up to 18 months. The lack of standardized interfaces for emerging technologies further exacerbates these challenges, as competing systems vie for market dominance.</p>
        
        <h3>The Rise of Liquid Cooling: A Supply Chain Transformation</h3>
        <p>Traditional air cooling, reliant on fans and computer room air conditioning (CRAC) units, is reaching its limits as rack densities increases. While air cooling benefits from mature supply chains and global availability, it cannot handle the heat generated by 1 MW racks. Liquid cooling, particularly direct-to-chip solutions, is emerging as the preferred alternative, offering up to 50% better energy efficiency, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.</p>
        <p>However, liquid cooling is still in its early stages of adoption, with only 20% of U.S. data centers using it as of 2025, per IDC estimates. This transition requires operators to forge new partnerships with specialized suppliers, such as those producing coolant distribution units and precision-engineered manifolds. Unlike air cooling’s standardized ecosystem, liquid cooling supply chains are fragmented, with varying designs and limited vendor options, posing risks to scalability and resilience.</p>
        
        <h3>Site Selection and Energy Constraints</h3>
        <p>The power demands of 1 MW racks are reshaping data center site selection. With urban power grids nearing capacity—PJM Interconnection reported a 145,000 MW peak demand in July 2025—operators are exploring remote locations with access to alternative energy sources. For example, natural gas deposits in Pennsylvania and wind farms in Iowa are attracting hyperscalers like Amazon and Google, which announced $20 billion and $7 billion investments, respectively, in these states.</p>
        <p>Developing greenfield sites in less accessible areas introduces logistical challenges. Shipping routes may be underdeveloped, and local warehousing for critical components is often limited. To mitigate these risks, operators are adopting just-in-time inventory models and regional distribution hubs, though these strategies increase costs. A 2025 Deloitte study estimates that logistics expenses for remote data center projects are 30% higher than for urban sites.</p>
        
        <h3>Building Resilient and Elastic Supply Chains</h3>
        <p>To navigate this complex landscape, data center operators must prioritize supply chain resilience and elasticity. Key strategies include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Diversifying suppliers:</strong> Engaging multiple vendors for critical components, such as GPUs and cooling systems, reduces dependency on single sources.</li>
            <li><strong>Collaborating on standards:</strong> Hyperscalers are working with organizations like the Open Compute Project to develop interoperable architectures, minimizing compatibility issues.</li>
            <li><strong>Investing in local production:</strong> Onshoring manufacturing for power and cooling components, as seen with recent U.S. investments in transformer production, shortens lead times.</li>
            <li><strong>Leveraging predictive analytics:</strong> AI-driven tools can forecast supply chain disruptions, enabling proactive inventory management.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Elasticity— the ability to adapt to changing technologies, timelines, and site constraints— is equally critical. For instance, modular data center designs allow operators to swap out power or cooling systems as standards evolve, reducing obsolescence risks. Companies like EdgeCore, which is building a 1.1 GW campus in Virginia, are adopting such approaches to future-proof their investments.</p>
        
        <h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
        <p>The transition to 1 MW racks and liquid cooling marks a pivotal moment for the data center industry. As AI workloads drive unprecedented demand, operators must rethink supply chain strategies to ensure resilience, scalability, and agility. By fostering supplier diversity, embracing standardization, and addressing energy and logistics challenges, the industry can meet the needs of the AI era while maintaining reliability. The stakes are high, but with proactive innovation, data centers can power the future of digital transformation.</p>

The Data Center Coalition reports that the industry contributed $2.1 trillion to U.S. GDP between 2017 and 2021, and projects like these are expected to create thousands of jobs, from construction to high-tech roles.</p>
        <p>However, the rapid expansion raises concerns about grid reliability and resource allocation. The closure of reliable baseload power sources, such as coal and nuclear plants, combined with slower-than-needed renewable energy development, has created a supply-demand mismatch. For example, PJM Interconnection, serving 67 million customers across 13 states, reported an 800% spike in power plant capacity costs in its 2024 auction, driven by data center demand. This has led to projected electricity bill increases of over 20% in some regions, with Pennsylvania businesses facing up to 29% hikes.</p>
        
        <h3>China’s Contrast: A Lesson in Speed</h3>
        <p>While the U.S. navigates regulatory and infrastructural challenges, China offers a contrasting model of rapid power plant construction. In 2024, China initiated 94.5 GW of new coal-fired power plants and resumed 3.3 GW of previously suspended projects, permitting an average of two large plants per week since 2022. Its nuclear sector is also booming, with 58 operational plants (60.88 GW) and 27 under construction (32.31 GW), achieving build times of five to seven years. China’s streamlined supply chains and focus on energy security enable this pace, a stark contrast to the U.S., where permitting delays and policy fragmentation slow progress. While China’s coal reliance raises environmental concerns, its ability to meet energy demand offers insights for U.S. policymakers aiming to balance reliability and sustainability.</p>
        
        <h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
        <p>The North American data center boom, driven by hyperscalers and AI demand, is reshaping the region’s digital and energy landscapes. With investments exceeding $31.5 billion in U.S. data center construction in 2024 alone, the industry shows no signs of slowing.

        <h2 onclick="togglePost(this)"><a href="#Grid-Maxed-Out">Grid at Breaking Point: AI Data Centers Push U.S. Power System to the Limit</a></h2>
        <div class="post-content">
            <time datetime="2025-07-22">July 23, 2025</time>
            <p>The surge in artificial intelligence (AI) is driving a massive increase in electricity demand, pushing America’s largest power grid, PJM Interconnection, to its limits. Serving 65 million people across 13 states and Washington, D.C., PJM has issued repeated “Maximum Generation” and “Load Management” alerts this summer as heatwaves and AI data centers strain capacity. With no spare power to meet this unprecedented demand, electricity prices are soaring, and the threat of blackouts looms. Here’s why the grid is maxed out and what it means for consumers.</p>

            <h3>AI Data Centers: A Power-Hungry Explosion</h3>
            <p>PJM’s territory includes Loudoun County, Virginia, dubbed “Data Center Alley,” the world’s largest hub for data centers. The rapid buildout of AI facilities is consuming electricity at an alarming rate, with modern server racks like Nvidia’s GB200 drawing 120 kW, double the 60–80 kW of older models. A single hyperscale data center can use 100–300 megawatts, enough to power tens of thousands of homes. The International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasts that global data center electricity use will double by 2026, reaching over 1,000 terawatt-hours, comparable to Japan’s annual consumption.</p>
            <p>“There is simply no new capacity to meet new loads,” Joe Bowring, president of Monitoring Analytics, PJM’s independent watchdog, told Bloomberg. He suggests data center operators build their own power generation, as the grid struggles to keep up. This summer’s alerts, triggered by heat-driven air conditioning demand, underscore the system’s fragility as AI compounds the strain.</p>

            <h3>Retiring Plants and Decarbonization Challenges</h3>
            <p>The grid’s capacity crisis is worsened by the retirement of coal and nuclear plants, driven by decarbonization policies. While renewable energy is critical, only 15% of new capacity added in 2024 came from renewables, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), with natural gas and coal filling the gap. Over 20% of PJM’s generating capacity is slated to retire by 2030, leaving the grid vulnerable. In Maryland, officials warn of potential rolling blackouts, noting the state cannot rely solely on imported power to meet demand.</p>

            <h3>Escalating Costs: The Capacity Auction Squeeze</h3>
            <p>PJM’s annual capacity auction, which compensates power producers for ensuring supply, has driven costs to new heights. This year’s auction reached $16.1 billion, up from $14.7 billion last year, with the capacity price per megawatt-day hitting $329.17, compared to $269.92 in 2024. The auction’s price floor ($177.24) and cap ($329.17) cleared at the maximum, prompting criticism of its fairness. Consumers are feeling the pinch, with the EIA reporting a 15% rise in residential electricity prices over five years and projections of 20–30% increases in PJM’s region due to AI-driven demand.</p>

            <h3>Who Wins, Who Loses?</h3>
            <p>Independent power producers like Constellation Energy, Talen Energy, NRG, and Vistra are capitalizing on the demand surge, investing over $34 billion in 2025 to acquire natural gas plants. Natural gas, powering 40% of U.S. electricity, is a key bridge fuel as renewables lag. However, consumers face higher bills, with posts on X highlighting that data center demand accounts for a significant portion of cost increases. Jon Gordon of Advanced Energy United noted that data centers are outpacing the grid’s ability to adapt, deepening supply shortages.</p>

            <h3>The Broader Challenge: A Grid on the Brink</h3>
            <p>The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) warns that PJM’s region risks power shortages by 2027 if demand growth continues unchecked. Data centers could consume 20% of U.S. electricity by 2030, up from 4% today, per McKinsey & Company. Solutions like requiring data centers to generate their own power could fragment the grid, while the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) explores capacity market reforms, a process that may take years.</p>

            <h3>Looking Forward: Solutions or Shortages?</h3>
            <p>Short-term fixes include flexible load strategies, such as Duke University’s Nicholas Institute proposal to unlock 18 GW through brief curtailments. Long-term, the U.S. needs investment in nuclear power, renewables, and grid upgrades. PJM’s Dave Souder noted that 45,000 MW of approved energy projects are stalled by supply chain and permitting issues. Consumers can adopt energy-efficient appliances or join demand response programs, but systemic change is critical to avoid blackouts and unaffordable bills.</p>
            <p>The AI revolution is transforming technology but exposing the U.S. grid’s vulnerabilities. Without urgent action, the balance between innovation and energy reliability will tip, leaving consumers to pay the price.</p>

        <h2 onclick="togglePost(this)"><a href="#AI-Power-Crisis">The AI Boom Is Sending Your Electricity Bills Through the Roof</a></h2>
        <div class="post-content">
            <time datetime="2025-07-23">July 22, 2025</time>
            <p>The relentless rise of artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming industries, but it’s also driving an unprecedented surge in electricity demand across the United States. The nation’s largest power grid, PJM Interconnection, which serves 65 million people across 13 states and Washington, D.C., is struggling to keep up. As data centers powering AI applications multiply, electricity costs are soaring to record highs, and consumers are left footing the bill. Here’s a deep dive into why your utility bills are climbing and what it means for the future.</p>

            <h3>A Perfect Storm: AI Data Centers and Strained Grids</h3>
            <p>PJM Interconnection, which spans from the Midwest to the mid-Atlantic, recently announced that businesses and households will pay a staggering $16.1 billion for electricity capacity in the year starting June 2026. This marks a significant jump from last year’s record of $14.7 billion, with the capacity price per megawatt-day hitting an all-time high of $329.17, up from $269.92. The reason? A massive buildout of power-hungry AI data centers, particularly in areas like Loudoun County, Virginia—known as “Data Center Alley,” the world’s largest hub for data centers.</p>
            <p>These data centers, which support the computational demands of AI models, consume electricity at levels comparable to small cities. For context, a single large data center can use 100–300 megawatts of power, enough to supply tens of thousands of homes. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), global data center electricity consumption is projected to double between 2022 and 2026, reaching over 1,000 terawatt-hours—roughly equivalent to Japan’s annual electricity use.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, PJM has faced challenges this summer, issuing multiple “Maximum Generation” and “Load Management” alerts as heatwaves pushed air conditioning demand to the brink. Joe Bowring, president of Monitoring Analytics, PJM’s independent watchdog, told Bloomberg, “There is simply no new capacity to meet new loads.” This mismatch between supply and demand is exacerbating the crisis, as older power plants retire and investments in new generation and grid upgrades lag behind.</p>

            <h3>Skyrocketing Costs and the Auction Controversy</h3>
            <p>PJM’s annual capacity auction, which determines how much power producers are paid to ensure reliable electricity supply, has become a lightning rod for controversy. This year’s auction, the first to include both a price floor ($177.24) and cap ($329.17), cleared at the maximum, raising questions about whether the process truly reflects market dynamics. Last year’s auction saw a 600% spike in capacity prices, sparking outrage and leading to a settlement with Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro to cap price increases for two years. Despite this, costs remain sky-high, with consumers in areas like Baltimore and Virginia facing rates as high as $466 and $444 per megawatt-day in previous auctions.</p>
            <p>The financial impact is already hitting consumers. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) reports that average residential electricity prices have risen by 15% over the past five years, and with AI-driven demand accelerating, further increases are likely. For households, this could mean monthly utility bills climbing by 20–30% in the coming years, particularly in regions served by PJM.</p>

            <h3>Winners and Losers in the AI Power Race</h3>
            <p>The surge in electricity demand has been a boon for independent power producers. Companies like Constellation Energy, Talen Energy, NRG, and Vistra have seen their stock prices soar, with Constellation and Talen surging in late trading following the auction results. As shown in the finance card above, Constellation Energy (CEG) closed at $323.70, Talen Energy (TAL) at $10.39, NRG at $160.55, and Vistra (VST) at $200.12 on July 23, 2025. These firms have invested over $34 billion this year alone, primarily acquiring natural gas plants to meet the AI-driven demand. Natural gas, which accounts for about 40% of U.S. electricity generation, is increasingly seen as a critical bridge fuel to power data centers while renewable energy projects struggle to scale.</p>
            <p>However, consumers and small businesses are bearing the brunt of these costs. Jon Gordon, policy director at Advanced Energy United, noted that new data centers are coming online faster than the grid can adapt, exacerbating supply shortages. Meanwhile, investments in renewable energy and grid modernization are not keeping pace. The EIA estimates that only 15% of new electricity capacity added in 2024 came from renewables, with natural gas and coal plants filling the gap.</p>

            <h3>The Bigger Picture: Can the Grid Keep Up?</h3>
            <p>The AI boom is just one part of a broader challenge facing the U.S. power grid. Aging infrastructure, retiring coal plants, and delays in renewable energy projects are creating a perfect storm. The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) has warned that parts of the U.S., including PJM’s region, face a high risk of power shortages by 2027 if demand continues to outstrip supply. Data centers are expected to account for 20% of U.S. electricity consumption by 2030, up from 4% today, according to McKinsey & Company.</p>
            <p>Proposed solutions, like requiring data center operators to build their own power generation, are gaining traction. However, this could lead to a patchwork of private energy systems, potentially undermining grid reliability and increasing costs further. On the policy front, regulators are under pressure to balance consumer protections with the need to incentivize new power generation. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) is exploring reforms to capacity markets, but meaningful changes could take years.</p>

            <h3>What Can Consumers Do?</h3>
            <p>For now, households and businesses face tough choices. Energy efficiency measures, such as upgrading to energy-efficient appliances or installing smart thermostats, can help offset rising costs. Some states offer demand response programs, where consumers are paid to reduce usage during peak periods. However, these are short-term fixes for a systemic issue that requires long-term investment in clean energy and grid infrastructure.</p>
            <p>The AI revolution is reshaping the world, but it’s also exposing the fragility of our energy systems. As data centers continue to proliferate, the tension between technological progress and energy affordability will only intensify. Without bold action, consumers may find themselves paying a steep price for a future powered by AI.</p>

    <div class="post-content">
        <time datetime="2025-07-20">July 20, 2025</time>
        <p>As global electricity demand is projected to double over the next two decades, the United States faces an unprecedented challenge to its energy infrastructure. This growth, unseen since the post-World War II era, is driven by the rise of AI-driven data centers, advanced manufacturing, and the push for electric vehicles. However, the nation’s aging electrical grid and shifting energy policies are struggling to keep pace, raising concerns about potential electricity rationing in the future.</p>
        
        <h3>The Growing Demand and a Strained Grid</h3>
        <p>The U.S. Energy Department recently highlighted the severity of the issue in a report, noting that “electricity demand from AI-driven data centers and advanced manufacturing is rising at a record pace.” The report emphasizes that current approaches to grid management and load addition are insufficient to meet this surge. PJM Interconnection, the largest U.S. power grid operator serving 67 million customers across 13 states, is already feeling the strain. Electricity bills in parts of PJM’s territory are expected to rise by over 20% this summer, with businesses in Pennsylvania facing increases as high as 29%.</p>
        <p>The rapid expansion of data centers, particularly in “Data Center Alley” in Northern Virginia, has exacerbated the problem. In PJM’s 2024 power grid auction, the cost for power plant capacity skyrocketed by 800%, jumping from $28.92 per megawatt-day in 2023 to $269.92 in 2024. This spike reflects the intense competition for power as tech giants secure capacity for their energy-hungry AI operations.</p>
        
        <h3>Policy Missteps and Energy Shortfalls</h3>
        <p>The current crisis has been years in the making, driven by energy policies that have prioritized short-term environmental goals over long-term reliability. Across the country, coal and nuclear power plants—reliable sources of baseload energy—have been shuttered, often replaced with less dependable solar and wind power. For example, New York’s Indian Point Power Plant was closed under former Governor Andrew Cuomo and Lieutenant Governor Kathy Hochul, a decision that has left the state scrambling to meet energy demands. Now, Governor Hochul is reportedly considering new nuclear power plants to address the shortfall.</p>
        <p>The premature closure of fossil fuel plants, combined with restrictions on expanding natural gas production—despite the U.S. having abundant reserves—has left the nation vulnerable to supply shortages. PJM’s 2024 annual report cites these state-level energy policies as a significant factor in the current supply-demand imbalance.</p>
        
        <h3>China’s Rapid Power Plant Construction: A Contrast</h3>
        <p>While the U.S. struggles to meet rising electricity demand, China has taken a markedly different approach, rapidly expanding its power generation capacity to keep pace with its growing energy needs. In 2024 alone, China began construction on 94.5 gigawatts (GW) of new coal-fired power plants, the highest level in a decade, and resumed 3.3 GW of previously suspended projects. Since 2022, China has permitted an average of two large coal power plants per week, with 106 GW permitted in 2022 and 70.2 GW of new construction-initiated in 2023. This aggressive buildout, driven by energy security concerns and coal industry interests, has solidified coal’s role in China’s energy mix, despite its commitments to peak carbon emissions by 2030.</p>
        <p>China’s nuclear power sector is also expanding at an unprecedented pace. As of 2024, China operates 58 nuclear power plants with a capacity of 60.88 GW, ranking third globally, and has 27 additional plants under construction, adding 32.31 GW. Since 2000, China has increased its operational nuclear reactors tenfold, with completion times for domestic reactor builds averaging five to seven years. For instance, the Hualong One reactor at Zhangzhou connected to the grid just 61 months after construction began. China’s ability to localize technology, streamline supply chains, and prioritize energy security has enabled it to build nuclear plants faster and more cost-effectively than most Western nations.</p>
        <p>This rapid construction stands in stark contrast to the U.S., where regulatory hurdles, prolonged permitting processes, and a lack of cohesive energy policy have slowed power plant development. While China’s reliance on coal raises environmental concerns, its ability to quickly deploy both fossil and nuclear capacity highlights a strategic focus on meeting energy demand, offering a potential lesson for the U.S. as it grapples with its own infrastructure challenges.</p>
        
        <h3>The Consequences: Rising Costs and Potential Rationing</h3>
        <p>The immediate impact of this energy crunch is already being felt in consumers’ wallets. With electricity costs soaring, households and businesses alike are bracing for higher bills. In Pennsylvania, the situation is dire enough that the governor has threatened to abandon PJM’s services if prices cannot be stabilized. Meanwhile, PJM’s CEO, Manu Asthana, announced his resignation effective at the end of 2025, signaling internal turmoil within the organization.</p>
        <p>Looking ahead, the combination of skyrocketing demand, an outdated grid, and insufficient new power generation raises the specter of electricity rationing. As policymakers push for widespread adoption of electric vehicles and issue warnings about “extreme heat” while urging consumers to limit air conditioning use, the irony is stark. The infrastructure needed to support these initiatives is simply not in place.</p>
        
        <h3>A Path Forward?</h3>
        <p>To avert a future of rationing and blackouts, the U.S. must act swiftly to modernize its electrical grid and expand reliable energy generation. This includes investing in new nuclear power plants, which provide consistent, carbon-free energy, and easing restrictions on natural gas development to bridge the gap while renewable technologies mature. Additionally, upgrading the nation’s grid infrastructure is critical to ensuring that power can be delivered efficiently to meet growing demand.</p>
        <p>The challenges are immense, but they are not insurmountable. However, they require a pragmatic approach to energy policy—one that balances environmental goals with the need for affordability and reliability. Without swift action, Americans may face a future where electricity is not just more expensive but also rationed, with profound implications for daily life and economic growth.</p>

    <div class="post-content">
        <time datetime="2025-07-16">July 16, 2025</time>
        <p>On July 16, 2025, PJM Interconnection, the largest U.S. power grid operator serving 65 million people across 13 states and Washington, D.C., issued a Maximum Generation Alert and Load Management Alert as temperatures soared across the eastern U.S. With a peak demand forecast of approximately 145,000 MW, PJM ordered all available generation resources to operate at full capacity to meet surging electricity needs driven by extreme heat. This alert, part of PJM’s procedural measures, signals tightening grid conditions and potential curtailments of power exports to neighboring regions, while advising transmission and generation owners to defer maintenance. The alert underscores broader challenges facing the U.S. power grid, including aging infrastructure, rising demand, and the complex transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.</p>
        
        <h3>Why the Alert Was Issued</h3>
        <p>The Maximum Generation Alert, accompanied by a NERC EEA Level 1 designation, reflects PJM’s proactive response to a high load forecast of 145,063 MW at 4 p.m. on July 16, driven by temperatures exceeding 90°F across its footprint, as forecasted by the NOAA Climate Prediction Center. This alert ensures all resources are committed to meet electricity demand, firm transactions, and reserve requirements, with concerns about sustaining contingency reserves. The Load Management Alert signals potential activation of demand response programs, where contracted customers reduce usage to alleviate grid stress. These measures are critical as PJM’s grid faces unprecedented pressure from rising demand, particularly from air conditioning during heatwaves, and a growing mismatch between supply and demand due to retiring fossil fuel plants.</p>[](https://insidelines.pjm.com/pjm-issues-hot-weather-alert-for-expected-heat-wave-june-22-25/)
        
        <h3>The Strain on America’s Largest Grid</h3>
        <p>PJM’s service area, spanning Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, and D.C., is experiencing a demand surge exacerbated by electrification, data centers, and industrial growth. The grid operator reported a preliminary peak load of 143,947 MW on July 15, with expectations of continued high demand. PJM’s summer forecast predicted a peak of 154,000 MW, but extreme scenarios could push demand beyond the record 165,563 MW set in 2006. The grid’s 179,200 MW of generation capacity and 7,900 MW of demand response are being stretched thin, particularly as 104 GW of firm generation is slated for retirement by 2030, with only 22 GW of firm baseload replacements planned. This imbalance, coupled with delays in new generation, heightens blackout risks, potentially increasing outage hours 100-fold by 2030.</p>[](https://www.energy.gov/articles/department-energy-releases-report-evaluating-us-grid-reliability-and-security)[](https://insidelines.pjm.com/pjm-issues-hot-weather-alert-for-expected-heat-wave-june-22-25/)[](https://insidelines.pjm.com/pjm-summer-outlook-2025-adequate-resources-available-for-summer-amid-growing-risk/)
        
        <h3>Aging Infrastructure and Transformer Challenges</h3>
        <p>The U.S. electrical grid, much of it built in the 1960s and 1970s, is ill-equipped for modern demands. Over 55% of distribution transformers are over 33 years old, nearing their 40-year lifespan, and 70% of transmission lines are over 25 years old. This aging infrastructure struggles to accommodate the integration of distributed energy resources like solar and wind, which require advanced grid management. Compounding this, transformer demand is projected to rise by up to 260% by 2050 due to EVs, data centers, and renewables, yet domestic production lags, with only 18% of large power transformers manufactured in the U.S. in 2019. Supply chain disruptions and tariffs further exacerbate shortages, leading to long lead times and increased costs, which threaten project timelines and grid reliability.</p>[](https://www.energy.gov/articles/department-energy-releases-report-evaluating-us-grid-reliability-and-security)
        
        <h3>The Energy Transition Dilemma</h3>
        <p>The shift from fossil fuels to renewables, while critical for sustainability, has created a “severe mismatch” between baseload capacity and rising demand. The Department of Energy warns that continued retirements of coal and natural gas plants without adequate replacements could lead to significant outages, particularly during extreme weather when wind and solar generation may falter. PJM’s recent actions, including the Department of Energy’s emergency order to keep Pennsylvania’s Eddystone Generating Station operational past its May 2025 retirement, highlight efforts to maintain reliability. However, the slow pace of new renewable projects, hampered by interconnection delays and local opposition, underscores the need for faster grid modernization and investment in firm baseload capacity, such as natural gas or nuclear, to bridge the gap.</p>[](https://www.energy.gov/articles/us-department-energy-issues-202c-emergency-order-safeguard-electric-grid-reliability-pjm)[](https://www.powermag.com/trump-administration-issues-third-emergency-order-to-prevent-pjm-power-shortfall/)[](https://www.eenews.net/articles/doe-plays-out-worst-case-scenarios-for-us-grid/)
        
        <h3>Strategies to Mitigate Grid Stress</h3>
        <p>PJM is implementing several measures to address these challenges. The Reliability Resource Initiative, launched in May 2025, selected 51 projects to add 9,361 MW of capacity, including natural gas, nuclear, and battery storage, with most expected online by 2030. Reforms to the interconnection process, including automation and AI-enhanced tools with Google and Tapestry, have reduced the project backlog by 60%. Demand response programs, compensating customers for reducing usage during peak times, provide critical relief, as seen in PJM’s activation of these programs in June 2025. Additionally, exploring remanufactured transformers and smart grid technologies, such as advanced power flow controls and predictive analytics, can enhance resilience and efficiency, helping to balance supply and demand.</p>[](https://insidelines.pjm.com/pjm-summer-outlook-2025-adequate-resources-available-for-summer-amid-growing-risk/)[](https://insidelines.pjm.com/pjm-chooses-51-generation-resource-projects-to-address-near-term-electricity-demand-growth/)
        
        <h3>Economic and Social Impacts</h3>
        <p>The grid’s strain has significant economic implications, with electricity prices surging over 20% in some PJM regions this summer due to tight supplies. For instance, next-day power prices at PJM’s West hub soared to $211 per MWh in June 2025, a 430% increase. Outages, if they occur, could cost millions per hour and disproportionately affect vulnerable communities, exacerbating inequities. However, investments in grid modernization and domestic transformer production, supported by initiatives like the proposed CIRCUIT Act, could create jobs and stimulate local economies, with data center construction alone contributing $243.5 million and 1,688 jobs per project. These efforts are vital for ensuring reliable power and supporting economic growth.</p>[](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/grid-operator-pjm-issues-maximum-generation-alert-monday-amid-heat-wave-2025-06-23/)[](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/americas-largest-power-grid-is-struggling-meet-demand-ai-2025-07-09/)
        
        <h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
        <p>PJM’s Maximum Generation Alert on July 16, 2025, highlights the urgent need for a resilient and modernized U.S. power grid. As temperatures soar and demand from AI-driven data centers, EVs, and electrification continues to climb, the grid faces unprecedented challenges. Aging infrastructure, transformer shortages, and the complex transition to renewables necessitate immediate action.

        <p>America’s electrical grid is under unprecedented strain, grappling with aging infrastructure and a dramatic surge in transformer demand driven by new technologies and energy transitions. With 55% of the nation’s distribution transformers exceeding 33 years of age and demand projected to increase by up to 260% by 2050 due to electric vehicles (EVs), data centers, and renewable energy projects, the U.S. faces a critical challenge in maintaining a reliable power supply. This article explores the dual pressures of an aging grid and escalating transformer demand, their impacts on infrastructure projects, and actionable strategies to address these issues, drawing on insights from industry trends and legislative efforts like the CIRCUIT Act.</p>
        
        <h3>The Aging Grid: A Ticking Time Bomb</h3>
        <p>The U.S. electrical grid, largely constructed in the 1960s and 1970s, is approaching the end of its operational life. According to a 2015 Department of Energy report, 70% of transmission lines are over 25 years old, and 55% of distribution transformers are more than 33 years old, nearing or exceeding their average 40-year lifespan. This aging infrastructure is ill-equipped to handle modern demands, leading to increased risks of outages, especially during extreme weather events. The grid’s vulnerabilities are compounded by the need for significant upgrades to accommodate distributed energy resources (DERs) like solar and wind, which require flexible and resilient systems. Without substantial investment, the aging grid threatens the reliability of power delivery across the country.</p>[](https://www.maddox.com/resources/articles/increased-transformer-demand-and-aging-grids)[](https://www.utilitydive.com/news/aging-grids-drive-51b-in-annual-utility-distribution-spending/528531/)
        
        <h3>Surging Transformer Demand: A Supply Chain Crisis</h3>
        <p>The rapid rise in transformer demand is driven by the proliferation of EVs, data centers for AI and cryptocurrency, and renewable energy projects. By 2050, transformer capacity is expected to increase by 260% to meet these needs, but current manufacturing capacity is woefully inadequate. In 2023, the U.S. imported $27.3 billion worth of transformers, with only 18% of large power class transformers (over 100 MVA) produced domestically in 2019. Supply chain disruptions, raw material shortages, and long lead times—often stretching months or years—have created a bottleneck, making it difficult for project managers to secure transformers for critical infrastructure. The competition for limited supplies is fierce, impacting data centers, renewable projects, and grid modernization efforts alike.</p>[](https://www.maddox.com/resources/articles/increased-transformer-demand-and-aging-grids)

        <p>Recent tariffs on imported electrical components, including transformers, have further complicated the supply chain landscape. These tariffs increase costs and prioritize domestic production, but the U.S. lacks sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet demand. The proposed Credit Incentives for Resilient Critical Utility Infrastructure and Transformers (CIRCUIT) Act, introduced on February 6, 2025, by Senators Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) and Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), aims to address this by offering a 10% tax credit to U.S. transformer manufacturers. This bipartisan legislation, part of the Inflation Reduction Act’s Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit, seeks to boost domestic production, create jobs, and move the U.S. toward energy independence. While promising, the CIRCUIT Act’s long-term benefits will take time to materialize, leaving project managers to navigate immediate challenges.</p>[](https://www.maddox.com/resources/articles/circuit-act)
        
        <h3>Strategies to Mitigate Supply Chain Delays</h3>
        <p>To address the transformer shortage, companies are turning to innovative solutions like remanufacturing and strategic procurement. Remanufactured transformers, restored to original operating conditions, offer a faster, more sustainable alternative to new units, consuming less energy and emitting fewer greenhouse gases. This aligns with the principles of a circular economy, which prioritizes extending the lifespan of existing equipment. Ordering equipment early, securing domestic or pre-tariff imported transformers, and maintaining flexibility in project specifications can also help mitigate delays. Collaborating with suppliers who maintain robust inventories of both new and remanufactured transformers ensures quicker access to compliant equipment, reducing project downtime.</p>[](https://www.maddox.com/resources/articles/increased-transformer-demand-and-aging-grids)[](https://www.maddox.com/resources/articles/transformers-circular-economy)
        
        <h3>Modernizing the Grid with Smart Technologies</h3>
        <p>Modernizing the aging grid requires more than just replacing transformers—it demands the integration of advanced technologies.

    <div id="BABA-Compliance-Guide"></div>
    <h2 onclick="togglePost(this)"><a href="#BABA-Compliance-Guide">Navigating the Build America, Buy America Act: A Guide for Infrastructure Projects</a></h2>
    <div class="post-content">
        <time datetime="2025-07-15">July 15, 2025</time>
        <p>The Build America, Buy America Act (BABAA), enacted in November 2021 as part of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, represents a pivotal shift in federal procurement policy, aiming to bolster domestic manufacturing and supply chains. Effective since May 14, 2022, BABAA mandates that federally funded infrastructure projects—spanning roads, bridges, harbors, airports, and utilities—use products manufactured in the United States, with at least 55% of the component costs sourced domestically. This article delves into the intricacies of BABAA, its implications for the electrical transformer industry, and strategies for navigating compliance amidst supply chain challenges and rising tariffs.</p>
        
        <h3>Understanding BABAA Requirements</h3>
        <p>The BABAA’s core objective is to strengthen U.S. manufacturing by ensuring that federal funds support American-made products. For a product to be BABAA-compliant, it must be manufactured in the U.S., and over 55% of the total cost of its components must be mined, produced, or manufactured domestically, as outlined in Section 70912(6)(B)(ii) of the Act. This applies to all federally funded infrastructure projects, including those in the utility sector, where electrical transformers are critical components. Non-compliance can jeopardize project funding, as federal agencies are prohibited from granting funds to projects using non-compliant products. Limited waivers exist, but they are not guaranteed and can introduce significant delays, making proactive compliance essential.</p>
        
        <h3>Impact on Electrical Transformers</h3>
        <p>Electrical transformers, vital for power distribution in infrastructure projects, are classified as manufactured products under BABAA. This means that for projects receiving federal funding, transformers must meet the 55% domestic component threshold. The challenge lies in the globalized nature of transformer supply chains. In 2023, the U.S. imported approximately $27.3 billion worth of transformers, with only 18% of large power class transformers (over 100 MVA) manufactured domestically in 2019. The BABAA requirements, combined with tariffs on imported goods, have intensified demand for U.S.-made transformers, creating a bottleneck as domestic production struggles to keep pace. This scarcity limits vendor options, potentially increasing costs and extending project timelines.</p>
        
        <h3>Navigating Supply Chain Challenges</h3>
        <p>The transformer industry is grappling with a supply-demand imbalance, exacerbated by BABAA’s domestic sourcing mandates. The global supply chain disruptions, coupled with tariffs, have led to longer lead times and higher costs for raw materials and components. To address these challenges, companies are increasingly turning to remanufactured transformers, which are restored to their original operating conditions and can be produced more quickly than new units. This approach helps mitigate delays while ensuring compliance with BABAA standards. Additionally, the proposed CIRCUIT Act aims to alleviate supply constraints by offering tax credits to U.S. transformer manufacturers, incentivizing domestic production and potentially stabilizing the market.</p>
        
        <h3>Strategies for BABAA Compliance</h3>
        <p>To successfully navigate BABAA requirements, project managers and procurement teams should adopt a proactive approach. First, verify the compliance status of suppliers early in the project planning phase to avoid delays. Partnering with manufacturers that prioritize domestic sourcing and maintain robust inventories can streamline procurement. Second, explore remanufactured transformers as a cost-effective and BABAA-compliant alternative, particularly for urgent projects. Finally, stay informed about legislative developments, such as the CIRCUIT Act, which could expand domestic manufacturing capacity.

    <div class="post-content">
        <time datetime="2025-06-16">June 16, 2025</time>
        <p>A June 13, 2025, DataCenterKnowledge article reports that the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) has issued a rare warning, identifying large data centers as one of the greatest near-term risks to U.S. electric grid reliability. The rapid expansion of AI and cryptocurrency mining facilities, outpacing power plant and transmission line development, threatens system stability, with significant outages already occurring in Northern Virginia. NERC’s 2025 State of Reliability Technical Assessment calls for urgent action to integrate these energy-intensive facilities smoothly. This article explores NERC’s findings, the impact of data centers on grid stability, and proposed solutions, drawing on the technical assessment available at <a href="https://www.nerc.com/pa/RAPA/PA/Performance%20Analysis%20DL/NERC_SOR_2025_technical_assessment.pdf" target="_blank">NERC’s 2025 State of Reliability Technical Assessment</a>.</p>
        
        <h3>NERC’s Warning: Data Centers as a Grid Risk</h3>
        <p>NERC’s 2025 report highlights that data centers, particularly those supporting AI and crypto mining, are connecting to grids faster than infrastructure can support, leading to “lower system stability.” These facilities demand vast, unpredictable power, with consumption patterns sensitive to voltage swings, creating a “major wild card” for grids unprepared for such loads. Mark Lauby, NERC’s chief engineer, noted at a May 2025 conference that 1.5 gigawatts (GW) of data centers tripped offline in Northern Virginia in July 2024, followed by 1.8 GW in February 2025, due to voltage issues. Such outages, comparable to a large nuclear plant going offline unexpectedly, can destabilize entire regions, per NERC’s assessment.</p>
        
        <h3>Impact on Grid Stability</h3>
        <p>Data centers’ power demands, projected to rise from 2.5% to 7.5% of U.S. electricity by 2030, exacerbate a national ~50 GW grid deficit, with blackout risks looming by 2035. Northern Virginia, the world’s data center capital, saw outages affecting 3.3 GW total, equivalent to 5% of the regional grid’s demand, causing ripple effects. The report notes that data centers’ sensitivity to voltage dips prompts automatic disconnections to on-site generators, creating sudden load losses that disrupt grid balance. This unpredictability, coupled with high-voltage cable shortages (lead times to 2029), challenges utilities like Dominion Energy, which face an 85% demand surge over 15 years.</p>
        
        <h3>AI and Crypto Driving Demand</h3>
        <p>The AI boom, deemed a national security imperative by Washington, fuels data center growth, with facilities like xAI’s Colossus requiring 1–5 MW per rack. Cryptocurrency mining, less regulated than Big Tech’s operations, adds further strain, with a Wood Mackenzie analysis estimating crypto’s grid demand equals 25% of Texas’s peak load. Unlike tech giants, crypto miners rarely build renewable energy projects, hindering grid decarbonization. NERC’s report underscores that data centers’ unpredictable power usage, unlike traditional industrial loads, requires new forecasting models to prevent imbalances, as seen in Virginia’s outages.</p>
        
        <h3>Proposed Solutions: Batteries and Grid Integration</h3>
        <p>NERC’s assessment suggests batteries are proving effective in stabilizing grids, smoothing data center power fluctuations. Applied Digital’s North Dakota facility, using 400 MW from a wind farm, exemplifies battery integration, per industry reports. Medium voltage load banks, with three-cable connections, test substation relay settings, ensuring reliability and reducing outage risks by 15%. NERC calls for better load forecasting models, urging utilities to update reliability standards for data centers and crypto miners. Proposals include requiring centers to “ride through” voltage dips without disconnecting, minimizing grid disruptions, though this risks tech firms relocating to less-regulated states.</p>
        
        <h3>Regional and Economic Context</h3>
        <p>Northern Virginia’s outages highlight regional vulnerabilities, with 60 data centers disconnecting in a single 2024 incident due to a failed surge protector, per Reuters. Arizona’s Phoenix hub, with projects like Novva’s 300 MW Mesa campus, faces similar grid constraints, consuming 16.5% of state electricity by 2030. Economic benefits, including 1,688 construction jobs and $243.5 million per project, are tempered by grid costs, with $9.4 billion in delayed U.S. projects since 2023. Posts on X reflect urgency, with users like @lwsresearch noting the need for better forecasting to manage AI-driven surges.</p>
        
        <h3>Future Outlook: Balancing Growth and Stability</h3>
        <p>NERC’s report projects a tripling of data center power demand by 2028, necessitating 300 GW of new U.S. nuclear capacity by 2050, per DOE estimates. Innovations like Microsoft’s Three Mile Island restart and Amazon’s SMR investments aim to meet this demand, but development timelines (5+ years) lag AI’s pace. On-site generation, as in Crusoe’s 1.2 GW Abilene, TX, project, bypasses grid congestion, while load bank testing ensures reliability. By 2035, updated standards and battery integration could stabilize grids, supporting AI’s national security role while preventing blackouts.</p>
        
        <h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
        <p>Data centers, critical for AI and digital services, pose a significant threat to U.S. grid reliability, as NERC’s 2025 assessment warns. Outages in Northern Virginia underscore the urgency of integrating these facilities, with 1.5–1.8 GW losses disrupting stability. Solutions like batteries, load bank testing, and revised standards offer hope, but a ~50 GW deficit looms. As hubs like Phoenix and Abilene expand, balancing economic growth with grid resilience is paramount. With NERC’s roadmap, the U.S. can harness AI’s potential while securing a stable energy future.

    <div class="post-content">
        <time datetime="2025-06-13">June 13, 2025</time>
        <p>A April 2, 2025, Circle of Blue article highlights the rising water demands of data centers in Arizona, a small but growing factor in the state’s water budget. As the Phoenix Valley emerges as a major data center hub, driven by AI and cloud computing, projects like Tract’s Buckeye Tech Corridor are reshaping land use and straining water resources in one of the driest regions of the U.S. With Arizona’s data centers projected to consume 905 million gallons of water in 2025, this article explores their impact, regulatory guardrails, technological innovations, and the broader implications for water management in a drought-prone state.</p>
        
        <h3>Data Centers Reshaping Arizona’s Landscape</h3>
        <p>In Buckeye, Arizona, a 2,069-acre parcel originally planned for 9,700 homes under the Cipriani community was sold in August 2024 to Tract, a Denver-based data center developer. Now part of the Buckeye Tech Corridor, the site will host up to 20 million square feet of commercial space for cloud computing, reflecting a shift from housing to tech infrastructure. Maricopa County, encompassing metro Phoenix, is one of the U.S.’s largest data center markets, with 164 facilities driven by cheap land, low power rates ($0.06–$0.069 per kWh), tax incentives, and proximity to 5 million residents. This growth, fueled by AI’s computational demands, raises concerns about water use in a region facing a megadrought.</p>
        
        <h3>Water Consumption: A Growing Concern</h3>
        <p>Bluefield Research estimates Arizona’s data centers will consume 905 million gallons (2,777 acre-feet) of water in 2025, a modest amount compared to agriculture but significant for local utilities. Data centers use water primarily for cooling servers, with evaporative systems consuming over half the water, which escapes into the atmosphere. Nationally, data center water use is surging, turning “drops into a flood,” as individual facilities become more efficient but overall demand accelerates. In Arizona, where groundwater is over-allocated and the Colorado River’s supply has dwindled, this growth pressures finite resources, prompting scrutiny from communities and regulators.</p>
        
        <h3>Regulatory Guardrails and Unequal Treatment</h3>
        <p>Arizona encourages data center growth through a 2013 sales tax exemption, benefiting 64 facilities, but has implemented guardrails. Chandler’s 2022 ordinance regulates siting and noise but limits water use via a 2015 policy, capping facilities at 115 gallons per day per 1,000 square feet, requiring external sources for excess needs. Marana’s December 2024 ordinance bans potable water use for data centers, reflecting water scarcity concerns. Unlike housing developments, which must recharge groundwater, data centers in areas without renewable surface water face fewer restrictions, fueling complaints from the homebuilding lobby about unequal treatment, as industrial users like Tract’s projects bypass stringent rules.</p>
        
        <h3>Technological Innovations: Zero-Water Solutions</h3>
        <p>Data centers are adopting water-efficient technologies to mitigate their impact. Closed-loop cooling systems, like those proposed by Microsoft in Mount Pleasant, recycle water, reducing consumption compared to evaporative systems. Adiabatic cooling, using outside air when temperatures are below 85°F, cuts water use but is less effective in Arizona’s blistering heat, often exceeding 113°F. Companies like Google and Meta are investing in water conservation, with Microsoft aiming for “zero-water” cooling in its Arizona facilities by 2021, though high temperatures limit efficacy. These innovations, paired with renewable energy like Arizona’s abundant solar, align with sustainability goals but cannot fully offset demand.</p>
        
        <h3>Water vs. Energy: A Dual Challenge</h3>
        <p>Glenn Williamson, CEO of the Canada Arizona Business Council, emphasizes energy as a greater concern than water, noting that water solutions are known but require action. Data centers’ energy demands, potentially 16.5% of Arizona’s electricity by 2030, strain utilities like APS and SRP, which rely on a 47% carbon-free mix. Medium voltage load banks, using a three-cable connection, test substation relay settings, ensuring reliable power delivery and reducing commissioning time by 25%. However, water remains a critical issue, with local utilities like Buckeye facing pressure from data centers’ 905 million gallon demand, equivalent to a city of 30,000–50,000 people.</p>
        
        <h3>Community and Environmental Impacts</h3>
        <p>Data centers offer economic benefits, creating high-tech jobs and boosting supply chains, but their environmental footprint sparks debate. Unlike agriculture, they use less water but compete with communities in water-scarce areas. Non-disclosure agreements obscure water usage details, fueling public distrust, as seen in Mesa’s halt on data center recruitment. In northern Virginia, the largest U.S. data center market, similar concerns highlight land and resource conflicts. Arizona’s rapid growth, with 3 million more residents expected by 2035, amplifies these tensions, as groundwater depletion looms in areas like Phoenix, per a 2025 hydrologist forecast.</p>
        
        <h3>Future Outlook: Balancing Growth and Scarcity</h3>
        <p>Arizona’s data center market is set to double by 2030, driven by AI’s computational needs. The Arizona Corporation Commission’s 2025 review of energy demands could lead to policies mandating on-site power, like small modular reactors (SMRs), or enhanced renewable-battery systems. Water management strategies, including stricter ordinances and zero-water cooling, will be crucial. Load bank testing ensures grid reliability, supporting projects like Tract’s Buckeye campus. By 2060, extreme heat and water scarcity could challenge Phoenix’s habitability, making sustainable data center practices essential for Arizona’s desert economy.</p>
        
        <h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
        <p>Arizona’s data centers, a small but growing factor in the state’s water budget, are reshaping the Phoenix Valley’s landscape and resource priorities. Consuming 905 million gallons in 2025, they strain local utilities in a drought-prone region.

                <div class="post-content">
                    <time datetime="2025-05-01">May 1, 2025</time>
                    <p>The United States faces a growing energy deficit, driven by surging demand from data centers and the decommissioning of coal plants, while China ramps up its coal-fired power capacity. President Donald Trump’s declaration of a national energy emergency aims to address this gap by boosting domestic energy production, particularly coal, leveraging America’s vast reserves.</p>
                    <h3>A 45GW Energy Deficit</h3>
                    <p>The rapid expansion of data centers, fueled by AI and cloud computing, is projected to require an additional 45 gigawatts (GW) of power in the U.S. This surge in demand is straining the nation’s grid, with the largest grid operator, PJM Interconnection, warning of potential shortfalls due to planned power plant retirements (<a href="https://www.pjm.com/library/reports-notices.aspx">PJM Interconnection Reports</a>). The Energy Information Administration (EIA) notes that coal production in 2023 was less than half of 2008 levels, exacerbating the challenge (<a href="https://www.eia.gov/coal/">EIA Coal Data</a>).</p>
                    <h3>China’s Coal Surge</h3>
                    <p>In contrast, China has significantly increased its coal power capacity, commissioning approximately 94.5 GW of new coal plants in 2024, the highest in a decade (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/chinas-coal-power-capacity-surges-2024-09-12/">Reuters</a>). This expansion, driven by energy security needs, contrasts sharply with global trends toward renewables and gas. China’s low electricity costs and robust infrastructure give it a competitive edge in meeting the energy demands of AI and other technologies (<a href="https://globalenergymonitor.org/projects/global-coal-plant-tracker/">Global Energy Monitor</a>).</p>
                    <h3>U.S. Coal Decommissioning</h3>
                    <p>In 2024, the U.S. decommissioned over 3 GW of coal-fired power capacity, part of a broader trend where 8 GW is slated for retirement in 2025, representing nearly 5% of the 2024 coal fleet (<a href="https://www.eia.gov/coal/">EIA Coal Data</a>). This reduction, driven by cheaper natural gas and renewables, has left the U.S. with about 200 coal plants generating 16% of its electricity. The closure of plants like the Homer City Power Plant in Pennsylvania, now being redeveloped into a data center campus, highlights the shift away from coal.</p>
                    <h3>America’s $9 Trillion Coal Reserves</h3>
                    <p>Despite the decline, the U.S. holds an estimated $9 trillion worth of coal reserves ready to be mined. Industry advocates argue that coal can be repurposed with cleaner technologies, such as Core Natural Resources’ efforts to create synthetic materials for lithium-ion batteries and carbon foam for aerospace applications (<a href="https://corenaturalresources.com/">Core Natural Resources</a>). These innovations aim to reduce reliance on foreign supply chains, particularly from China.</p>
                    <h3>Trump’s National Energy Emergency</h3>
                    <p>On January 20, 2025, President Trump declared a “national energy emergency” under the National Emergencies Act, emphasizing domestic fossil fuel production with his “drill, baby, drill” mantra. The White House announcement highlighted the need to fast-track energy infrastructure to meet rising demand (<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2025/04/08/reinvigorating-americas-beautiful-clean-coal-industry/">White House Executive Order</a>). Executive orders signed in April 2025 aim to extend the life of coal plants and allow mining on federal land, reversing environmental regulations to keep older, dirtier plants operational (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2025/04/08/trump-coal-executive-orders/">Washington Post</a>).</p>
                    <p>Trump’s actions, however, face challenges. Experts note that coal’s decline is primarily due to market forces—cheap natural gas and renewables—rather than regulations alone. The New York Times reports that these economic realities may limit the impact of Trump’s policies (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/18/business/energy-environment/trump-coal-revival.html">New York Times</a>). Critics also warn of environmental trade-offs, as coal combustion emits more carbon and pollutants than other fuels (<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/trumps-latest-executive-orders-aim-to-bolster-coal-power-and-mining-and-allow-more-pollution/">Scientific American</a>).</p>

                <div class="post-content">
                    <time datetime="2025-04-30">April 30, 2025</time>
                    <p>At the Hill and Valley Forum in Washington, D.C. (<a href="https://hillandvalleyforum.org/events/2025">Hill and Valley Forum</a>), Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang delivered a stark warning about the intensifying AI supremacy race between the U.S. and China, while highlighting AI’s transformative potential to revolutionize industries and create a surge in trade jobs.</p>
                    <h3>A Fierce, Infinite AI Race</h3>
                    <p>In an interview with CNBC’s <em>Squawk on the Street</em> (<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/04/30/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-on-ai-race-and-innovation.html">CNBC Interview</a>), Huang emphasized the closeness of the competition. <span class="quote">“China is right behind us. We’re very, very close,”</span> he said, framing the rivalry as a long-term endeavor. <span class="quote">“This is a long-term, an infinite race. In the world of life, there’s no two-minute drill or end of the quarter.”</span> His remarks underscore the high stakes of AI development, with both nations investing heavily in the technology that promises to reshape global economies (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-china-ai-race-intensifies-2025-04-28/">Reuters</a>).</p>
                    <h3>AI’s Industrial Transformation</h3>
                    <p>During a conversation with Jacob Helberg, Under Secretary of State for Economic Growth, Energy, and the Environment nominee, Huang outlined AI’s impact on manufacturing. He predicted a shift toward autonomous systems across industries. <span class="quote">“Every company that makes things today—whether lawnmowers or construction machinery—will shift from manual to autonomous or semi-autonomous systems,”</span> he said. This transition will require “AI factories” to produce the software that powers these systems, alongside traditional factories building physical products (<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2025/04/15/ai-revolutionizing-manufacturing-autonomous-systems/">Forbes</a>).</p>
                    <h3>A Net-Positive for Jobs</h3>
                    <p>Huang acknowledged that AI will disrupt the labor market but argued its overall impact will be positive. <span class="quote">“New jobs will be created, some jobs will be lost, every job will be changed,”</span> he said, pointing to San Francisco’s AI-driven economic revival as evidence. The shift from human-coded software on CPUs to machine-learning-generated code on GPUs is creating new roles in data curation and AI safety. <span class="quote">“All of that technology is being invented right now, and it creates tons of jobs,”</span> Huang noted (<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ai-job-creation-trade-skills-2025-04-20">Wall Street Journal</a>).</p>
                    <h3>The Rise of AI Factories</h3>
                    <p>The most significant opportunity, according to Huang, lies in the construction of “AI factories”—massive facilities that convert electricity into computational intelligence. These factories represent a new industrial frontier, with a single one-gigawatt facility costing $60 billion, comparable to Boeing’s annual revenue (<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-25/ai-factories-to-cost-billions-nvidia-ceo-says">Bloomberg</a>). Huang described plans for even larger 7-10 gigawatt factories, which will drive demand for skilled labor. <span class="quote">“You need carpenters, steelworkers, masons, mechanical and electrical engineers, plumbers, and IT specialists,”</span> he said, estimating a three-year construction cycle per factory (<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/04/22/ai-factories-demand-skilled-trades/">MIT Technology Review</a>).</p>
                    <p>Huang’s vision paints a future where AI not only fuels technological innovation but also revitalizes the skilled trades, creating a new wave of economic opportunities.</p>

                <div class="post-content">
                    <time datetime="2025-04-29">April 29, 2025</time>
                    <p>Buckle up, because Kevin O’Leary, aka Mr. Wonderful, is diving headfirst into the A.I. revolution, and he’s got his sights set on North Dakota with a jaw-dropping 45 GW of power to fuel the future! Here’s why his plan is as bold as his Shark Tank zingers—and why you should be paying attention (<a href="https://www.valleynewslive.com/2023/03/21/kevin-oleary-make-major-investment-north-dakota/">Valley News Live</a>).</p>
                    <h3>A.I. and Data Centers: The Gold Rush of the 2020s</h3>
                    <p>If you’re 25 and hungry for opportunity, Mr. Wonderful’s dropping wisdom like it’s a Shark Tank pitch: A.I. implementation and data center development are where the money’s at. Small businesses are tripping over themselves to adopt A.I. but don’t know where to start. That’s your cue—swoop in, solve their problems, and cash in. Meanwhile, data centers are the backbone of this tech tsunami. With hyperscalers like Tesla, Microsoft, and Google gobbling up capacity faster than you can say “cloud computing,” real estate and tech are colliding in the most lucrative way possible. As O’Leary puts it, “This is where the future’s heading. Don’t miss it” (<a href="https://www.datacenterfrontier.com/wonder-valley-and-the-great-ai-pivot-kevin-olearys-bold-data-center-play/">Data Center Frontier</a>).</p>
                    <h3>Alberta’s Got Gas, But North Dakota’s Got Guts</h3>
                    <p>While O’Leary’s raising $70 billion to build the world’s lowest-cost, highest-efficiency data center in Alberta—powered by abundant natural gas and a premier who’s all-in (<a href="https://calgaryherald.com/business/varcoe-kevin-oleary-proposes-ai-data-centre-park-alberta/">Calgary Herald</a>, <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/shark-tanks-mr-wonderful-building-worlds-largest-ai-data-center-canada/">TechRepublic</a>)—North Dakota’s stealing the spotlight. Why? It’s got the land, the power, and the leadership to make A.I. and data centers thrive. With 45 GW on the table, North Dakota’s ready to power the A.I. revolution like nobody’s business. O’Leary’s already investing here, and he’s shouting it from the rooftops (or at least on AM 1100 The Flag): “Data centers, A.I., agtech, drones—North Dakota’s wide open for business!” (<a href="https://kevinoleary.com/the-wonder-fund-kevin-oleary-partnership-looks-to-help-north-dakotas-entrepreneurs/">Kevin O’Leary Official</a>, <a href="https://blogs.und.edu/und-today/2024/02/kevin-oleary-president-armacost-talk-tech-business-and-north-dakota/">UND Today</a>).</p>
                    <h3>China’s Out, North Dakota’s In</h3>
                    <p>Mr. Wonderful’s not mincing words: China’s been “stealing from American entrepreneurs for years,” and it’s time they face the music. Meanwhile, North Dakota’s rolling out the red carpet for innovation. Forget the Great Wall—think Great Plains, where A.I., data centers, and agtech are about to make waves. O’Leary’s betting big, and he’s got the receipts to prove it (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-china-ai-race-intensifies-2025-04-28/">Reuters</a>).</p>
                    <h3>Watch Mr. Wonderful Break It Down</h3>
                    <p>Don’t just take our word for it—check out O’Leary laying out the vision himself in this video from AM 1100 The Flag. It’s got all the energy of a Shark Tank deal about to close:</p>
