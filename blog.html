    <div class="post-content">
        <time datetime="2025-05-14">May 14, 2025</time>
        <p>The AI revolution is driving transformative advancements in data center infrastructure, with projects like OpenAI’s Stargate and cutting-edge cooling solutions from Intel and Shell leading the charge. The Stargate project’s Phase 1 construction in Abilene, Texas, sets a new benchmark for hyperscale AI facilities, while Intel’s certification of Shell’s immersion cooling fluids marks an industry-first for energy-efficient data center operations. These developments address the escalating power and thermal demands of AI workloads, reshaping the future of computing. This article explores the Stargate project, Intel-Shell’s cooling innovation, and their broader implications for AI data centers. <a href="https://www.nextbigfuture.com/2025/05/openai-stargate-phase-1-construction-of-200-megawatts-and-980000-square-feet.html" target="_blank">Read about Stargate’s Phase 1</a>.</p>
        
        <h3>OpenAI’s Stargate Phase 1: A Hyperscale Milestone</h3>
        <p>The Stargate project, a $500 billion joint venture between OpenAI, Oracle, SoftBank, and MGX, is constructing its flagship data center in Abilene, Texas, with Phase 1 underway. This phase includes two buildings totaling 980,000 square feet and over 200 MW of power capacity, set to be energized in the first half of 2025. The facility will support GPU installations for OpenAI’s AI models, with plans to scale to 1 million GPUs by late 2025 or Q1 2026. A 360.5 MW natural gas plant and solar power with battery storage will ensure reliable energy, addressing grid constraints. Stargate’s expansion plans include additional U.S. sites and global locations, aiming to establish a network of sovereign AI infrastructure. Despite tariff-related delays slowing financing, the Abilene site’s progress signals robust momentum. <a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/natural-gas-plant-planned-for-stargate-ai-data-center-campus-report/" target="_blank">Learn about Stargate’s power plans</a>.</p>[](https://www.nextbigfuture.com/2025/05/openai-stargate-phase-1-construction-of-200-megawatts-and-980000-square-feet.html)[](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/natural-gas-plant-planned-for-stargate-ai-data-center-campus-report/)
        
        <h3>Intel and Shell’s Immersion Cooling Breakthrough</h3>
        <p>Intel, in collaboration with Shell, has achieved an industry-first by certifying Shell’s lubricant-based immersion cooling fluids for Xeon-based data centers, as announced on May 13, 2025.

                <div class="post-content">
                    <time datetime="2025-05-01">May 1, 2025</time>
                    <p>The United States faces a growing energy deficit, driven by surging demand from data centers and the decommissioning of coal plants, while China ramps up its coal-fired power capacity. President Donald Trump’s declaration of a national energy emergency aims to address this gap by boosting domestic energy production, particularly coal, leveraging America’s vast reserves.</p>
                    <h3>A 45GW Energy Deficit</h3>
                    <p>The rapid expansion of data centers, fueled by AI and cloud computing, is projected to require an additional 45 gigawatts (GW) of power in the U.S. This surge in demand is straining the nation’s grid, with the largest grid operator, PJM Interconnection, warning of potential shortfalls due to planned power plant retirements (<a href="https://www.pjm.com/library/reports-notices.aspx">PJM Interconnection Reports</a>). The Energy Information Administration (EIA) notes that coal production in 2023 was less than half of 2008 levels, exacerbating the challenge (<a href="https://www.eia.gov/coal/">EIA Coal Data</a>).</p>
                    <h3>China’s Coal Surge</h3>
                    <p>In contrast, China has significantly increased its coal power capacity, commissioning approximately 94.5 GW of new coal plants in 2024, the highest in a decade (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/chinas-coal-power-capacity-surges-2024-09-12/">Reuters</a>). This expansion, driven by energy security needs, contrasts sharply with global trends toward renewables and gas. China’s low electricity costs and robust infrastructure give it a competitive edge in meeting the energy demands of AI and other technologies (<a href="https://globalenergymonitor.org/projects/global-coal-plant-tracker/">Global Energy Monitor</a>).</p>
                    <h3>U.S. Coal Decommissioning</h3>
                    <p>In 2024, the U.S. decommissioned over 3 GW of coal-fired power capacity, part of a broader trend where 8 GW is slated for retirement in 2025, representing nearly 5% of the 2024 coal fleet (<a href="https://www.eia.gov/coal/">EIA Coal Data</a>). This reduction, driven by cheaper natural gas and renewables, has left the U.S. with about 200 coal plants generating 16% of its electricity. The closure of plants like the Homer City Power Plant in Pennsylvania, now being redeveloped into a data center campus, highlights the shift away from coal.</p>
                    <h3>America’s $9 Trillion Coal Reserves</h3>
                    <p>Despite the decline, the U.S. holds an estimated $9 trillion worth of coal reserves ready to be mined. Industry advocates argue that coal can be repurposed with cleaner technologies, such as Core Natural Resources’ efforts to create synthetic materials for lithium-ion batteries and carbon foam for aerospace applications (<a href="https://corenaturalresources.com/">Core Natural Resources</a>). These innovations aim to reduce reliance on foreign supply chains, particularly from China.</p>
                    <h3>Trump’s National Energy Emergency</h3>
                    <p>On January 20, 2025, President Trump declared a “national energy emergency” under the National Emergencies Act, emphasizing domestic fossil fuel production with his “drill, baby, drill” mantra. The White House announcement highlighted the need to fast-track energy infrastructure to meet rising demand (<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2025/04/08/reinvigorating-americas-beautiful-clean-coal-industry/">White House Executive Order</a>). Executive orders signed in April 2025 aim to extend the life of coal plants and allow mining on federal land, reversing environmental regulations to keep older, dirtier plants operational (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2025/04/08/trump-coal-executive-orders/">Washington Post</a>).</p>
                    <p>Trump’s actions, however, face challenges. Experts note that coal’s decline is primarily due to market forces—cheap natural gas and renewables—rather than regulations alone. The New York Times reports that these economic realities may limit the impact of Trump’s policies (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/18/business/energy-environment/trump-coal-revival.html">New York Times</a>). Critics also warn of environmental trade-offs, as coal combustion emits more carbon and pollutants than other fuels (<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/trumps-latest-executive-orders-aim-to-bolster-coal-power-and-mining-and-allow-more-pollution/">Scientific American</a>).</p>

                <h2 onclick="togglePost(this)"><a href="#AI-Supremacy-Race">Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang on U.S.-China AI Race and the Trade Jobs Boom</a></h2>
                <div class="post-content">
                    <time datetime="2025-04-30">April 30, 2025</time>
                    <p>At the Hill and Valley Forum in Washington, D.C. (<a href="https://hillandvalleyforum.org/events/2025">Hill and Valley Forum</a>), Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang delivered a stark warning about the intensifying AI supremacy race between the U.S. and China, while highlighting AI’s transformative potential to revolutionize industries and create a surge in trade jobs.</p>
                    <h3>A Fierce, Infinite AI Race</h3>
                    <p>In an interview with CNBC’s <em>Squawk on the Street</em> (<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/04/30/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-on-ai-race-and-innovation.html">CNBC Interview</a>), Huang emphasized the closeness of the competition. <span class="quote">“China is right behind us. We’re very, very close,”</span> he said, framing the rivalry as a long-term endeavor. <span class="quote">“This is a long-term, an infinite race. In the world of life, there’s no two-minute drill or end of the quarter.”</span> His remarks underscore the high stakes of AI development, with both nations investing heavily in the technology that promises to reshape global economies (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-china-ai-race-intensifies-2025-04-28/">Reuters</a>).</p>
                    <h3>AI’s Industrial Transformation</h3>
                    <p>During a conversation with Jacob Helberg, Under Secretary of State for Economic Growth, Energy, and the Environment nominee, Huang outlined AI’s impact on manufacturing. He predicted a shift toward autonomous systems across industries. <span class="quote">“Every company that makes things today—whether lawnmowers or construction machinery—will shift from manual to autonomous or semi-autonomous systems,”</span> he said. This transition will require “AI factories” to produce the software that powers these systems, alongside traditional factories building physical products (<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2025/04/15/ai-revolutionizing-manufacturing-autonomous-systems/">Forbes</a>).</p>
                    <h3>A Net-Positive for Jobs</h3>
                    <p>Huang acknowledged that AI will disrupt the labor market but argued its overall impact will be positive. <span class="quote">“New jobs will be created, some jobs will be lost, every job will be changed,”</span> he said, pointing to San Francisco’s AI-driven economic revival as evidence. The shift from human-coded software on CPUs to machine-learning-generated code on GPUs is creating new roles in data curation and AI safety. <span class="quote">“All of that technology is being invented right now, and it creates tons of jobs,”</span> Huang noted (<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ai-job-creation-trade-skills-2025-04-20">Wall Street Journal</a>).</p>
                    <h3>The Rise of AI Factories</h3>
                    <p>The most significant opportunity, according to Huang, lies in the construction of “AI factories”—massive facilities that convert electricity into computational intelligence. These factories represent a new industrial frontier, with a single one-gigawatt facility costing $60 billion, comparable to Boeing’s annual revenue (<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-25/ai-factories-to-cost-billions-nvidia-ceo-says">Bloomberg</a>). Huang described plans for even larger 7-10 gigawatt factories, which will drive demand for skilled labor. <span class="quote">“You need carpenters, steelworkers, masons, mechanical and electrical engineers, plumbers, and IT specialists,”</span> he said, estimating a three-year construction cycle per factory (<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/04/22/ai-factories-demand-skilled-trades/">MIT Technology Review</a>).</p>
                    <p>Huang’s vision paints a future where AI not only fuels technological innovation but also revitalizes the skilled trades, creating a new wave of economic opportunities.</p>

                <div class="post-content">
                    <time datetime="2025-04-29">April 29, 2025</time>
                    <p>Buckle up, because Kevin O’Leary, aka Mr. Wonderful, is diving headfirst into the A.I. revolution, and he’s got his sights set on North Dakota with a jaw-dropping 45 GW of power to fuel the future! Here’s why his plan is as bold as his Shark Tank zingers—and why you should be paying attention (<a href="https://www.valleynewslive.com/2023/03/21/kevin-oleary-make-major-investment-north-dakota/">Valley News Live</a>).</p>
                    <h3>A.I. and Data Centers: The Gold Rush of the 2020s</h3>
                    <p>If you’re 25 and hungry for opportunity, Mr. Wonderful’s dropping wisdom like it’s a Shark Tank pitch: A.I. implementation and data center development are where the money’s at. Small businesses are tripping over themselves to adopt A.I. but don’t know where to start. That’s your cue—swoop in, solve their problems, and cash in. Meanwhile, data centers are the backbone of this tech tsunami. With hyperscalers like Tesla, Microsoft, and Google gobbling up capacity faster than you can say “cloud computing,” real estate and tech are colliding in the most lucrative way possible. As O’Leary puts it, “This is where the future’s heading. Don’t miss it” (<a href="https://www.datacenterfrontier.com/wonder-valley-and-the-great-ai-pivot-kevin-olearys-bold-data-center-play/">Data Center Frontier</a>).</p>
                    <h3>Alberta’s Got Gas, But North Dakota’s Got Guts</h3>
                    <p>While O’Leary’s raising $70 billion to build the world’s lowest-cost, highest-efficiency data center in Alberta—powered by abundant natural gas and a premier who’s all-in (<a href="https://calgaryherald.com/business/varcoe-kevin-oleary-proposes-ai-data-centre-park-alberta/">Calgary Herald</a>, <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/shark-tanks-mr-wonderful-building-worlds-largest-ai-data-center-canada/">TechRepublic</a>)—North Dakota’s stealing the spotlight. Why? It’s got the land, the power, and the leadership to make A.I. and data centers thrive. With 45 GW on the table, North Dakota’s ready to power the A.I. revolution like nobody’s business. O’Leary’s already investing here, and he’s shouting it from the rooftops (or at least on AM 1100 The Flag): “Data centers, A.I., agtech, drones—North Dakota’s wide open for business!” (<a href="https://kevinoleary.com/the-wonder-fund-kevin-oleary-partnership-looks-to-help-north-dakotas-entrepreneurs/">Kevin O’Leary Official</a>, <a href="https://blogs.und.edu/und-today/2024/02/kevin-oleary-president-armacost-talk-tech-business-and-north-dakota/">UND Today</a>).</p>
                    <h3>China’s Out, North Dakota’s In</h3>
                    <p>Mr. Wonderful’s not mincing words: China’s been “stealing from American entrepreneurs for years,” and it’s time they face the music. Meanwhile, North Dakota’s rolling out the red carpet for innovation. Forget the Great Wall—think Great Plains, where A.I., data centers, and agtech are about to make waves. O’Leary’s betting big, and he’s got the receipts to prove it (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-china-ai-race-intensifies-2025-04-28/">Reuters</a>).</p>
                    <h3>Watch Mr. Wonderful Break It Down</h3>
                    <p>Don’t just take our word for it—check out O’Leary laying out the vision himself in this video from AM 1100 The Flag. It’s got all the energy of a Shark Tank deal about to close:</p>
